<br>
Note by Manveru : Check 2DAs section for more 2DA files description to edit more
sophisticated kits features.<br>
<br>
Now when you know a little about the files, can we start the creation of your Kit!<br>
<br>
Step 1:<br>
<br>
Open ABCLASRQ.2DA in notepad or if you prefer word pad.<br>
Scroll down until you reach Barbarian. Now under him, write the name at your kit!!!<br>
/REMEMBER THAT IF THERE IS SPACES IN YOUR KIT USE _ (UNDERSCORE) INSTEAD OF EMPTY SPACE/<br>
<br>
It will look something like this:<br>
<br>
</p>

<p><br>
-When you are done, then copy the line, that you just have created-<br>
Close the file, and save it!<br>
<br>
Step 2:<br>
<br>
Open ABDCDSRQ.2DA, and scroll down to LATHANDER, under him paste the line that you copied<br>
from ABCLASRQ.2DA<br>
<br>
It will look something like this:<br>
</p>

-Close the file, and save it.<br>
<br>
Step 3:<br>
<br>
Open ABDCSCRQ.2DA, and scroll down to LATHANDER, under him paste the line that you copied<br>
from ABCLASRQ.2DA<br>
<br>
It will look something like this:<br>
</p>

<p><br>
-Close the file, and save it.<br>
<br>
Step 4:<br>
<br>
Open ALIGNMNT.2DA and scroll down to WILDMAGE, under him, write the name at your Kit!<br>
<br>
Now, at the top of the document can you see this:<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>                        L_G     L_N     L_E     N_G     N_N     N_E     C_G     C_N     C_E

C_G: Chaotic Good , C_N: Chaotic Neutral , C_E: Chaotic Evil<br>
<br>
( 1 Means: ALLOWED / 0 Means NOT ALLOWED )<br>
<br>
Now, the button at the document will look something like this:<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>BARBARIAN               1       1       1       1       1       1       1       1       1

MY_KIT</pre>
<p><br>
It's now time to give your kit the Alignments it can choose among.<br>
If he only may play Lawful Good (Like Paladins) will you have to write this:<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>BARBARIAN               1       1       1       1       1       1       1       1       1

<p><br>
-When you are done, close and save the file.<br>
<br>
Step 5:<br>
<br>
Open CLASWEAP.2DA, and scroll down to LATHANDER, and write the name at your kit under it.<br>
<br>
It will look something like this:<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>BEAST_FRIEND            1           0           1           1           0           0           0           1
TALOS                   1           1           1           1           1           1           1           1
HELM                    0           0           1           1           0           1           0           0
LATHANDER               0           0           1           1           0           1           0           0
MY_KIT</pre>
<p><br>
Now is it time to choose which kind of weapons your kit may use.<br>
If your kit may use ALL kind of weapons, then you will have to write this:<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>BEAST_FRIEND            1           0           1           1           0           0           0           1
TALOS                   1           1           1           1           1           1           1           1
HELM                    0           0           1           1           0           1           0           0
LATHANDER               0           0           1           1           0           1           0           0
MY_KIT                  1           1           1           1           1           1           1           1</pre>
<p><br>
-When you are done, close and save the file.<br>
<br>
Step 6:<br>
Now this is a VERY important step, be sure to follow it CORRECTLY!<br>
Open KITLIST.2DA, and scroll down to BARBARIAN<br>
<br>
It will look like this:<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>30   WILDMAGE       54893 54894 54892 CLABMA01  52           0x80000000	1
31   BARBARIAN      45855 45859 45869 CLABFI05  51           0x40000000	2</pre>
<p><br>
Under 31 write 32. Space to the beginning of BARBARIAN, and write the name at your kit.<br>
Now it will look something like this:<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>30   WILDMAGE       54893 54894 54892 CLABMA01  52           0x80000000	1
31   BARBARIAN      45855 45859 45869 CLABFI05  51           0x40000000	2
32   MY_KIT</pre>
<p><br>
Now scroll up, and find the words: LOWER MIXED HELP&nbsp;<br>
This is REALLY REALLY important!!! Under those 3 words, can you see a whole lot of numbers!<br>
Open your Infinity Engine Editor (Pro)<br>
/if you don't got this one, can you download it at www.teambg.com , until then can we not continue!/<br>
<br>
Click at Dialog.tlk editor<br>
<br>
When the program open, can you see 3 small round buttons, push at Write (The TextCursor witch to another cell)!<br>
Now write the name at your kit (with small letters, also exchange spaces with _ (underscore)<br>
<br>
Push the "Write to Dialog" button<br>
<br>
An box appears with some text an a number, write down this number, at a piece of paper.<br>
<br>
Now go to the box, where you wrote your kit name.<br>
Erase it, and write the name again! This time with the first letter Big or if it's
2 words, then write the letter,<br>
that both words begin with Big, AND this time also with a normal space instead of an _ (underscore)<br>
<br>
See if the small button still is standing at Write, if not, chance it to it.<br>
<br>
Push the "Write to Dialog" button<br>
<br>
Again do the box appear, BUT this time with a new number. Write that at a piece of paper to.<br>
<br>
Now it's time to make up the story about your kit! Lets say that it's a Dragon Slayer Kit, that you have created,<br>
then you should write something like this (IN THE SAME BOX IN THE EDITOR):<br>
<br>
Dragon Slayer<br>
The Dragon Slayer is one of the most skilled fighters,&nbsp;<br>
there ever have been trained. They..... and so on<br>
<br>
When you are done, see if the small button, should have moved from Write, if it have change it back to Write.<br>
<br>
Push the "Write to Dialog" button<br>
<br>
Again you receive a number, write it down.<br>
Close the editor, and turn back into Notepad or whatever program you opened the .2DA files in.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It should still look like this:<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>30   WILDMAGE       54893 54894 54892 CLABMA01  52           0x80000000	1
31   BARBARIAN      45855 45859 45869 CLABFI05  51           0x40000000	2
32   MY_KIT</pre>
<p><br>
Now write the first number you got from the editor under 45855. I got 62334.<br>
Under 45859 write the next number. I got 62335.<br>
Under 45869 write the next number. I got 62336.<br>
<br>
Now should it look something like this:<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>30   WILDMAGE       54893 54894 54892 CLABMA01  52           0x80000000	1
31   BARBARIAN      45855 45859 45869 CLABFI05  51           0x40000000	2
32   MY_KIT         62334 62335 62336</pre>
<p><br>
Now, again take a look at KITLIST.2DA, under abilities can you see a long colorn where the first 4 letters is CLAB.<br>
You can also see a colorn where the headline is PROFICIENCY, then come UNUSABLE and CLASS.<br>
/The easiest way to figure out, how this work, is to let you gain the necessary experiences/<br>
<br>
But to make this easy, will he get just the same as the BARBARIAN. Copy: CLABFI05  51           0x40000000	2<br>
and paste it just after the last number you wrote.<br>
Now will your file look something like this:<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>30   WILDMAGE       54893 54894 54892 CLABMA01  52           0x80000000	1
31   BARBARIAN      45855 45859 45869 CLABFI05  51           0x40000000	2
32   MY_KIT         62334 62335 62336 CLABFI05  51           0x40000000	2</pre>
<p><br>
<br>
-Close the file, and save it.<br>
/The only way to learn this right is to try it a couple of times, and whoops is it just as easy as making pancakes./<br>
<br>
Hold it, do we want to create our very own CLAB files? Sure we do... we are editors
after all, right?<br>
If you have chosen to do as I wrote above, then go straight to Step 7! If you want to learn more about CLAB-files,<br>
then continue reading!<br>
<br>
The clab-files control the abilities your new kit gets through his level ups.<br>
Try take a look at the monk, he gains a lot of special attacks, as abilities, this is written in the CLAB-files.<br>
<br>
Here is an example:<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>2DA V1.0
****
            1              2               3
ABILITY1    GA_MYTHING     ****            **** 
ABILITY2    ****           GA_MYTHING2     **** 
ABILITY3    ****           ****            GA_MYTHING3 </pre>
<p><br>
Here can you see an example of how the CLAB-file functions... Ability 1 is gained as level 1, Ability 2 at level 2 etc.&nbsp;<br>
Of course can they be mixed, but you'll figure out later on, it's not difficult, but
you'll find out soon, as I said.<br>
<br>
MYTHINGx refers to spells, made as Innate ( abilities ) in the Spell Maker ( found in IEEP ). BUT they refers to the NAMES&nbsp;<br>
of the files ( in windows ), which shall be in the override folder.<br>
<br>
Now am I sure that you wonder why it says GA_ in front of the filenames, this is also a thing
you'll have to know, for being able to understand it. And I guess that you'll be even more confused when I say, that you also can write AP_ in front of the
original filename. But here is the key: GA means Gain Ability, gives much more sense now, but if you still are
doubling why it's there, then imagine that it's a command, saying that when you becomes Level 2 then do you get ability 6, ( look it DOES
NOT have to be the same level and ability ). Well GA is a ability which you'll be the one to
decide when to use, but AP is<br>
quite different, it activates the ability, and you'll not be able to decide when you want to use it or not. So this is why,
AP only should be used in cases where you get a item ( yes a item, you are able to give your kit a new item, when it becomes
level x ). But it can of course be used in other cases, but you'll find out, when
you'll need it.<br>
<br>
So this is actually how a CLAB file functions, it's pretty easy when first you have found the logic, so here I
recommend you to remember the differences between GA_ and AP_, and do also always
remember the _ (underscore) after GA and AP, it won't work otherwise. Do also remember that the item or spells name ( in widows ), not may
exceed 8 letters. Do also remember to extract the spell you want to use, and modify it in Spell Maker to a ability,
forgetting this, will just result in a non-working thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Step 7:<br>
<br>
In the folder "Files to Edit, is another folder called K_x_x Files.<br>
You have to open one of those files to determine wich race, there will be allowed to play with your Kit.<br>
Now, let´s say that you only will let humans and elfs play your kit, and they HAVE yo be fighters.<br>
<br>
Then open the folder K_x_x , and find the file K_F_H (this stand for Kit_Fighter_Human)<br>
It should look like this:<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>      KIT
1	0
2	1
3	2
4	3</pre>
<p><br>
<br>
Now write 5, under 4, and 32 under 3. (You have to do this because: First you have to tell BG2 that there is 5 Kits,
and Kit number 5 is number 32 as you wrote in KITLIST.2DA&nbsp; /REMEMBER: 32   MY_KIT (just under 31 BARBARIAN)/<br>
<br>
Now it should look like this:<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>      KIT
1	0
2	1
3	2
4	3
5       32</pre>
<p><br>
-When you are done, close and save the file.<br>
Now do just the same to the file called: K_F_E (stand for Kit_Fighter_Elf / Simple right?/)<br>
<br>
Step 8:<br>
<br>
This class does NOT use the Lay on Hands, so there is no need to edit that. An advice could be to experiment a little
with that your self, cause as I have wrote earlier in this document, is it a little
tricky.<br>
<br>
The last file we have to edit is WEAPPROF.2DA.&nbsp;<br>
Open it, and scroll all the way to the side, until you reach WILDMAGE. Make 2 spaces after WILDMAGE, and write the name at your Kit.
Now is it time to set the masteries, that your kit can get in the different weapons, but lets make it easy and say,&nbsp;
that he can become Grant Master at everything.<br>
Then it will look something like this:<br>
<br>
</p>
