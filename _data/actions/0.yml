  This action can be used to do nothing - many characters walk around randomly or stand in one place doing nothing:

  ```
  IF
    True()
  THEN
    RESPONSE #50
      RandomWalk()
    RESPONSE #50
      NoAction()
  END
  ```

  `NoAction()` is also commonly used as a hanging (dummy) action in targeting blocks. This is a matter of good practice rather than necessary. The `NoAction()` action will never be run since the block always returns false, but having an action in the scripting block allows scripting programs to accurately check for errors.

  ```
  IF
    See(NearestEnemyOf(Myself))
    False()
  THEN
    RESPONSE #100
      NoAction()
  END
  ```
