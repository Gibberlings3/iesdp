  This action removes the active creature from the game. No death variable is set. Global creatures like 
  joinable NPCs, familiars and recipients of `MakeGlobal` are still accessible by script name and are not
  fully removed. The example script is from the Irenicus cutscene at the beginning of the game.

  ```
  IF
    True()
  THEN
    RESPONSE #100
      CutSceneId("CSCowl7")
      ForceSpell("CSIren",0)
      Wait(1)
      DestroySelf()
  END
  ```
