  This action pauses the game. Script processing is halted while the game is paused.

  The action only works when used by PC or FAMILIAR. However, it's not enough to just set EA to FAMILIAR. The calling creature must be global and added as a familiar via scripting. Futhermore, it appears that `AddFamiliar()` is not instant, so calling `PauseGame()` right after it won't work. To workaround, another command must be added to the script just before.

  Working code example:

  ```
  IF
    OnCreation()
  THEN
    RESPONSE #100
      MakeGlobal()
      AddFamiliar()
      SmallWait(1)
      PauseGame()
  END
  ```
