    TobEx: Stacking ID. Checked when bit 25 of the Saving Throw Type is set.

    If two effects of the same opcode are applied, both have Limit Effect Stacking bit set, and both have the same stacking ID, then the latter applied effect is suspended in application until the former effect expires. Regardless of whether it is applied, the latter effect will expire at the same time that it would expire if it was applied. In other words, the total duration of some non-stacking effect opcode is not extended because more than one copy of the effect was applied.

    Stacking IDs are unique to the opcode being applied. To maintain uniqueness of stacking IDs between different mods, one recommendation is to use the higher word of Special as the modder's Infinity Engine Community Prefix, then use the lower word as an identifying ID. For example, 0x41360001 ('A6' 0x0001).

    Resistance

    The default behaviour is that effects cannot be dispelled and ignore resistance.
    - bit 0 ⟶ Can be dispelled, affected by resistance
    - bit 1 ⟶ Ignores resistance (when used in combination with bit 0)
    - <b><a name="0x5C_BIT2">bit 2</a></b> ⟶ Bypasses deflection/reflection/trap opcodes (only in EE games patched to v2.0+)
    - bit 31 ⟶ Effect was applied by an [ITM](../ie_formats/itm_v1.htm) (only present in EE games patched to v2.0+).
      - It is set by the engine if the effect's source [ITM](../ie_formats/itm_v1.htm) is identified. This bit is only used by [opcode #324](../../opcodes/bgee.htm#op324) which checks it to determine whether it should set <code><a href="../../files/2da/2da_bgee/enginest.htm#128">STRREF_FEEDBACK_IMMUNE_RESOURCE</a></code> to the ITM's general or identified name.

    This can also be presented in the more traditional way:
    - 0 ⟶ Nonmagical
    - 1 ⟶ Can be dispelled/Affected by resistance
    - 2 ⟶ Cannot be dispelled/Ignores resistance
    - 3 ⟶ Can be dispelled/Ignores resistance
