      - Affects all creatures in the current area with the same <code><a href="../../files/ids/bgee/specific.htm">SPECIFIC.IDS</a></code> value as the ability target. (Ability must target a creature, not a location, container, door, etc...)

      - Affects Caster, as the specified projectile impacts its target(s), once or for each target depending on the projectile's flags. The specified projectile only determines when/if it's applied, while it's still applied using projectile `#1|None`.

    ITM global (equipped) effects: Target is always the wearer, this field isn't relevant.

    Timing Mode

    - 0 ⟶ <b><a name="V1_Feature_Block_0xC_0">Duration</a></b>
      - This timing mode measures <code><a href="#V1_Feature_Block_0xE">duration</a></code> in seconds.
    - 1 ⟶ Permanent
    - 2 ⟶ While equipped
    - 3 ⟶ Delayed Duration
    - 4 ⟶ Delayed
    - 5 ⟶ Delayed (transforms to 8)
    - 6 ⟶ Duration?
    - 7 ⟶ Permanent?
    - 8 ⟶ Permanent (unsaved)
    - 9 ⟶ Permanent (after Death)
    - 10 ⟶ <b><a name="V1_Feature_Block_0xC_10">Trigger / Ticks</a></b>
      - This timing mode just measures <code><a href="#V1_Feature_Block_0xE">duration</a></code> in ticks instead of seconds, there is nothing special about it beyond that. It allows for more accurate synchronization with mechanics that use the full `100 ticks = 1 round`.
      - If <code><a href="#V1_Feature_Block_0xE">duration</a> = 0</code>, it won't function any differently from timing mode <code><a href="#V1_Feature_Block_0xC_0">0</a></code>.
    - 4096 ⟶ <b><a name="V1_Feature_Block_0xC_4096">Absolute duration</a></b>
      - This timing mode treats the <code><a href="#V1_Feature_Block_0xE">duration</a></code> field as the effect's expiration time (in ticks).
        If the <code><a href="#V1_Feature_Block_0xE">duration</a></code> field is 108000, the effect will expire when the game timer reaches 24 hours, or instantly if the game timer has already passed that point. `108000 = 300(1 hour) * 24 * 15 (ticks ➔ seconds)`.

    NB. all effects except those with Timing mode `9` are removed by death.

    Resistance

    The default behaviour is that effects cannot be dispelled and ignore magic resistance.

    - bit 0 ⟶ Can be dispelled, affected by magic resistance
    - bit 1 ⟶ Ignores magic resistance (when used in combination with bit 0)

    This can also be presented in the more traditional way:
    - 0 ⟶ Natural/Nonmagical
    - 1 ⟶ Can be dispelled/Affected by resistance
    - 2 ⟶ Cannot be dispelled/Ignores resistance
    - 3 ⟶ Can be dispelled/Ignores resistance

    The only difference between `0` and `2` is that `0` will automatically convert to `2` when targeting yourself.

    Probability 2

    Note: The BG1 engine treats probability as a single word, effects are applied in the range 0-probability.  
    Note: Other engines treat probability as two values, effects are applied in the range probability <= x <= probability.  
    Probability range is 0-99

    Saving Throw Type

    - bit 2: Death
    - bit 3: Wands
    - bit 4: Polymorph
    - bit 10: Ignore primary target – Line AoE projectile doesn't affect end target (EE only)
    - bit 11: Ignore secondary target – Line AoE projectile doesn't affect bystanders (EE only)
    - bit 24: Bypass mirror image (EE/TobEx only)
    - bit 25: EE - ignore difficulty; TobEx - limit effect stacking
    - bit 26: TobEx internal (don't use) - suspend effect application

    NB. If more than 1 saving throw type is specified, the target rolls against their best save.

    TobEx: Stacking ID. Checked when bit 25 of the Saving Throw Type is set.

    If two effects of the same opcode are applied, both have Limit Effect Stacking bit set, and both have the same stacking ID, then the latter applied effect is suspended in application until the former effect expires. Regardless of whether it is applied, the latter effect will expire at the same time that it would expire if it was applied. In other words, the total duration of some non-stacking effect opcode is not extended because more than one copy of the effect was applied.

    Stacking IDs are unique to the opcode being applied. To maintain uniqueness of stacking IDs between different mods, one recommendation is to use the higher word of Special as the modder's Infinity Engine Community Prefix, then use the lower word as an identifying ID. For example, 0x41360001 ('A6' 0x0001).
