Applies the berserk effect to the targeted creature(s) in the style specified by the 'Type' parameter.
<br/>Known values for 'Type' are:
<br/>0 Default/In Combat -> Only berserk while in combat.
<br/>1 Constant -> always berserk, sets SPELLSTATE 39 (only in EEs).
<br/>2 Blood Rage -> always berserk, sets SPELLSTATE 35 (only in EEs)
<br/>Target will uncontrollably attack enemies if any are in view, and will occasionally
attack neutral creatures.

In Combat(0) = Only berserk while in combat. Constant(1) = always berserk, sets SPELLSTATE 39. Usable against party members and non-party members. Forces creature to use a melee weapon if possible.

<p>
The affected creature becomes berserk and its AI scripts stop running. Grants a +2 bonus to hit and damage with all weapons. It also sets the STATE_BERSERK flag.
