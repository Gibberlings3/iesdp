Applies the berserk effect to the targeted creature(s).
<br/>Target will uncontrollably attack enemies if any are in view, and will occasionally
attack neutral creatures.

<p>
The affected creature becomes berserk and its AI scripts stop running. Grants a +2 bonus to hit and damage with all weapons. It also sets the STATE_BERSERK flag.
