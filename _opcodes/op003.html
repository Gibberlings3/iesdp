Applies the berserk effect to the targeted creature(s) in the style specified by the <code>Type</code> field.

<br/>Target will uncontrollably attack enemies if any are in view, and will occasionally attack neutral creatures.

<br/>Known values for <code>Type</code> are:
<ul>
	<li>0 &longrightarrow; Default/In Combat: only berserk while in combat.</li>
	<li>1 &longrightarrow; Constant: always berserk, maintains <a href="../files/ids/bgee/splstate.htm#33">BERSERK_ALWAYS_ACTIVE</a> (only in EEs).</li>
	<li>2 &longrightarrow; Blood Rage: doesn't exist in EE's, values <code>2+</code> function the same as <code>0</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This opcode sets the <a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT1">STATE_BERSERK</a> flag.
</p>

{% capture note %}
Being "in combat" is reliant upon the presence of visible, non-sleeping enemies, but they will attack anyone they can see (including sleeping creatures), ally, neutral, or enemy, without preference (beyond whom is closer).

Used with <code>Timing Mode</code>s <code>1/4/7</code> results in setting <a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT1">STATE_BERSERK</a> when it triggers (and using its default behavior), rather than attaching a removable effect with selected behavior.
