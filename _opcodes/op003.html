Applies the berserk effect to the targeted creature(s) in the style specified by the 'Type' field.
<br/>Target will uncontrollably attack enemies if any are in view, and will occasionally attack neutral creatures.
<br/>Known values for 'Type' are:
<br/>0 Default/In Combat -> Only berserk while in combat.
<br/>1 Constant -> always berserk, sets SPELLSTATE 39 - ANIMAL_RAGE (only in EEs).
<br/>2 Blood Rage -> this is probably not implemented. It should be linked to SPELLSTATE 35 - SUPPRESS_HP_INFO. (only in EEs)

<p>
The affected creature becomes berserk and its AI scripts stop running. Grants a +2 bonus to hit and damage with all weapons. It also sets the STATE_BERSERK flag.

Used with timing modes 1/4/7 results in setting STATE_BERSERK when it triggers (and using its default behavior), rather than attaching a removable effect with selected behavior.
