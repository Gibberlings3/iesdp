<p>
The Dice values can be used to inflict varying damage amounts - e.g. 2d6 would do 2-12 damage (Damage type is still specified by the 'Type' value).
<br/>If 'Damage Amount' and the Dice values are both non-zero, the total damage inflicted is: 'Damage Amount' + Dice value.
<br/>'Damage Amount' can be positive or negative (though the damage sound will play in either case).

{% capture note %}
'Stunning' damage does not stun the target. Stunning damage cannot kill a creature, creatures are reduced to 1 HP and are knocked unconscious.
