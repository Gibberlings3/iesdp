Applies the invisibility effect, in the style specified by the <code>Type</code> value.
<br/><br/>

Known values for <code>Type</code> are:
<ul>
	<li>
		0 &longrightarrow; Normal Invisibility
		<ul>
			<li>Grants a <code>+4</code> bonus to melee attacks only.</li>
			<li>Applying <code>Normal</code> Invisibility with <code>Timing Mode</code>s other than <code>1/4/7</code> in an external <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a> through <a href="#op183">opcode #183</a> will NOT terminate early due to hostile/aggressive action (similar to the constant invisibility provided by Mislead). Applying the same through <a href="#op177">opcode #177</a> or <a href="#op283">opcode #283</a> DOES terminate due to hostile/aggressive action as normal.</li>
			<li>Applying <code>Normal</code> Invisibility with <code>Timing Mode</code>s <code>1/4/7</code> will set the creature's base state <code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm#CREV1_0_Header_0x20_BIT4">STATE_INVISIBLE</a></code>, while still leaving behind a removable (but irrelevant) effect. This state is not cleared on death, but it is still terminated by any hostile/aggressive action that would normally terminate invisibility.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		1 &longrightarrow; Improved Invisibility
		<ul>
			<li>Affected creature stays invisible after attack.</li>
			<li>Does not provide saving throw bonuses outside EEs, where it provides a bonus of <code>4</code> to all.</li>
			<li>Lingers after the duration is spent and act as permanent if used as a 'While Equipped' effect.</li>
			<li>Applying <code>Improved</code> Invisibility will cause the effect to be duplicated, with the duplicate using <code>Normal</code> invisibility. There's no reason to apply both <code>Normal</code> and <code>Improved</code> invisibility in the same spell/item (unless you want them to have different probabilities/hd limits).</li>
			<li>Applying <code>Improved</code> Invisibility with <code>Timing Mode</code>s <code>1/4/7</code> will set the creature's base state <code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm#CREV1_0_Header_0x20_BIT22">STATE_IMPROVEDINVISIBILITY</a></code>, and because it duplicates itself as <code>Normal</code> invisibility, <code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm#CREV1_0_Header_0x20_BIT4">STATE_INVISIBLE</a></code> as well, while still leaving behind a removable (but irrelevant) effect for each. These states are not cleared on death.</li>
			<li>The effects that remain when setting the base <code>STATE</code>s are irrelevant, at least in-game, because everything that can remove the <code>STATE</code>s will also remove the effect. The <code>STATE</code>s can however be removed separately through NI or EEkeeper, at which point the effect will once again reapply its <code>STATE</code> immediately upon loading the game.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		2 &longrightarrow; Weak Invisibility (EE only)
		<ul>
			<li>It's the same type of invisibility as <code>Improved</code> Invisibility after you take a hostile action and reveal yourself.</li>
			<li>Applying "Weak" Invisibility with <code>Timing Mode</code>s <code>1/4/7</code> will function no differently than <code>Timing Mode 0</code>, aside from having no natural expiration timer.</li>
			<li>Applying "Weak" Invisibility is otherwise the same as <code>Improved</code> Invisibility, except it doesn't duplicate itself with a <code>Normal</code> version, which is why it doesn't quality for backstabs.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

{% capture note %}
Any attack a character makes while invisible will ignore the target's AC dexterity bonus (see <code><a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/dexmod.htm">dexmod.2da</a></code>)
<br><br>

To be exact, the attack must follow these rules:
<ol>
	<li>Attacker must have a backstab multiplier of <code>2</code> or higher (see <code><a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/backstab.htm">backstab.2da</a></code>)</li>
	<li>Attacker must be <code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm#CREV1_0_Header_0x20_BIT4">STATE_INVISIBLE</a></code></li>
	<li>Attacker's weapon must <u>not</u> be <code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/itm_v1.htm#itmv1_Extended_Header_0x0_2">RANGED</a></code></li>
</ol>
<code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm#CREV1_0_Header_0x273">Class</a></code> / <code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm#CREV1_0_Header_0x244">Kit</a></code> doesn't matter, <code><a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/sneakatt.htm">sneakatt.2da</a></code> doesn't matter (even though the backstab multiplier isn't used to calculate damage under "Game Option: 3E Sneak Attack", the creature still has its multiplier calculated / assigned), weapon backstab suitability doesn't matter.

	In the following example:
	<ul>
		<li>Attacking character <code>THAC0 &equals; 17</code></li>
		<li>Attacked character <code>AC &equals; 0</code>, (dexterity contributing <code>-4</code> bonus)</li>
	</ul>
	The thief's attack only requires a total roll of <code>13</code> to hit, even though a roll of <code>17</code> is required normally:

	<br>

	<b>However, this mechanic isn't implemented properly...</b>
	<br><br>

	If the attacked character has a <i>penalty</i> to AC due to dexterity, they will be harder to hit while being attacked under the above conditions.<br />
	In the following example:
	<ul>
		<li>Attacking character <code>THAC0 &equals; 17</code></li>
		<li>Attacked character <code>AC &equals; 9</code>, (dexterity contributing <code>+5</code> penalty)</li>
	</ul>
	The thief's attack should only require a total roll of <code>8</code> to hit, though a roll of <code>13</code> is now required:

Creatures attacking an invisible creature suffer a <code>-4</code> penalty to hit, unless they are affected by <a href="#op193">opcode #193</a>. Moreover, you cannot target an <code>improved</code>/<code>weak</code> invisible creature with spells unless you're affected by <a href="#op193">opcode #193</a> or the spell <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/spl_v1.htm#Header_Flags_BIT24">can target invisible creatures</a>.
