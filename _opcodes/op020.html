Applies the invisibility effect, in the style specified by the 'Type' value.
<br/>Known values for 'Type' are :
<br/>0   Normal Invisibility   -> affected creature makes the first attack with +4
<br/>1   Improved Invisibility -> affected creature stays invisible after attack
<br/>2   Weak Invisibility -> It's the same type of invisibility as 'Improved Invisibility' after you take a hostile action and reveal yourself.

{% capture note %}
'Improved Invisibility' does not provide saving throw bonuses - This is not true for EEs. In particular, it provides a bonus of 4 to all saving throws (the same holds for 'Weak Invisibility').

{% capture note %}
'Improved Invisibility' lingers after the duration is spent and act as permanent if used as a 'While Equipped' effect
{% endcapture %}

{% capture note %}
'Weak Invisibility' is not by itself sufficient to trigger backstabs.

{% capture note %}
Creatures attacking an improved/weak invisible creature suffer a -4 penalty to hit, unless they are affected by #193 Invisible Detection by Script. Moreover, you cannot target an improved/weak invisible creature with spells unless you're affected by #193 or the spell can target invisible creatures.
