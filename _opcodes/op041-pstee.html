Produces a sparkle effect by playing BAM animation instances specified by the <code>resource</code> key, with the behavior defined by <code>Type</code>. <code>Amount</code> defines the number of additional BAM copies displayed by each animation instance.

<p>
A non-zero Dice Number value appears to influence the probability of showing the effect. Higher values indicate higher probabilities of showing the effect. Value seems to be capped at 256.
</p>

Known values for <code>Type</code> are:
<ul>
	<li>1 &longrightarrow; Explosion
		<ul>
      <li>Plays a random amount of animation instances, including no instances at all, which follow a random path away from the target to simulate an "explosion" effect.</li>
			<li>Duration is defined by the number of BAM animation frames.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>2 &longrightarrow; Swirl
    <ul>
      <li>Plays a number of animation instances a certain distance over the target, with each instance using a slightly shifted offset to simulate a "swirl" effect.</li>
      <li>Duration is defined by the number of BAM animation frames.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
	<li>3 &longrightarrow; Sparkle Shower
		<ul>
      <li>Plays a number of animation instances a certain distance over the target. Each instance is generated following a circular pattern and slowly falling down to simulate a "shower" effect.</li>
      <li>Duration is defined by the number of BAM animation frames.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
