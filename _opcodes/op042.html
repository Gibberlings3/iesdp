Alters the number of wizard spell slots available to the targeted creature(s), as specified by the 'Slot Amount Modifier' field, at the level specified by the 'Spell Level' field. Wizard spells are used by Bards, Sorcerers and Wizards in IWD2.
<br/>Known values for 'Spell Level' are:
<br/>0   Double spells
<br/>1   Level 1
<br/>2   Level 2
<br/>4   Level 3
<br/>8   Level 4
<br/>16  Level 5
<br/>32  Level 6
<br/>64  Level 7
<br/>128 Level 8
<br/>256 Level 9
<br/>For a 'Spell Level' of 0, the amount of spell slots is doubled for the level specified by the 'Slot Amount Modifier' value and all levels below. The target creature(s) must have at least 1 slot at the selected level to have their slot count changed. If the resultant slot count is negative, the creature is given 12 slots.
<br/>'Statistic Modifier' can be positive or negative.
