This effect polymorphs the target into a specific creature animation set (i.e. you can change Vhailor into Annah, if you wished, etc). To figure out the Animate Set parameter value, do the following:
<br/>Look up the value for the Animation Set you wish to use for this effect in the RESDATA.INI file (it'll be the number in the brackets directly above it), then do the following:
<br/>If you want the animation to be falsely/'clown' coloured, add 24576
<br/>If you want the animation to be true coloured, add 57344

{% capture note %}
