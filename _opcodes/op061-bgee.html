Works similar to <a href="#op8">opcode #8</a>/<a href="#op9">opcode #9</a>, except:
<ul>
	<li>It always affects the entire creature (not a specific location).</li>
	<li>It is always "instantaneous". No effect is attached to the creature, it's all handled by internal mechanics, but it still uses the specified duration. Saving &AMP; Reloading will remove the effect.</li>
	<li>It starts with full color overlay, then fades out over the specified duration (to the creature's normal color), then fades back to a full color overlay, then instantly returns to the creature's normal colors.</li>
</ul>

<br/><br/>The <code>RGB Colour</code> field is handled as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Second byte = Red (<code>0–255</code>)</li>
	<li>Third byte = Green (<code>0–255</code>)</li>
	<li>Fourth byte = Blue (<code>0–255</code>)</li>
</ul>

<br/>The <code>Location and Fade Speed</code> field is handled as follows:
<ul>
	<li>First byte = Location (unused, it always affects everything. Leave it at <code>0</code>)</li>
	<li>Third byte = Fade Speed (<code>0–255</code>)</li>
</ul>

<br/>A speed of <code>0</code> does not pulsate. A speed of <code>1</code> is fastest, and a speed of <code>255</code> is slowest.
