Works similar to <a href="#op8">opcode #8</a>/<a href="#op9">opcode #9</a>, except:
<ul>
	<li>It always affects the entire creature (not a specific location).</li>
	<li>It is always "instantaneous". No effect is attached to the creature, it's all handled by internal mechanics, but it still uses the specified duration. Saving &AMP; Reloading will remove the effect.</li>
	<li>The creature will instantly be covered by a color overlay which then fades out. The color overlay will not fade back in. It's otherwise similar to <a href="#op50">opcode #50</a>, where the color overlay fades onto the creature and then fades back out.</li>
</ul>

<br/>The <code>RGB Colour</code> field is handled as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Second byte = Red (<code>0–255</code>)</li>
	<li>Third byte = Green (<code>0–255</code>)</li>
	<li>Fourth byte = Blue (<code>0–255</code>)</li>
</ul>

<br/>The <code>Location and Fade Speed</code> field is handled as follows:
<ul>
	<li>First byte = Location (unused, it always affects everything. Leave it at <code>0</code>)</li>
	<li>Third byte = Fade Speed (<code>0–255</code>)</li>
</ul>

<br/>A speed of <code>0</code> does not pulsate. A speed of <code>1</code> is fastest, and a speed of <code>255</code> is slowest.
