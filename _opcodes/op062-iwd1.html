<br/>For a 'Spell Level' of 0, the amount of spell slots is doubled for the level specified by the 'Slot Amount Modifier' value and all levels below. For a 'Spell Level' of 512, the amount of spell slots is doubled for the level(s) specified by the 'Slot Amount Modifier' field. The target creature(s) must have at least 1 slot at the selected level to have their slot count changed. If the resultant slot count is negative, the creature is given 12 slots.
