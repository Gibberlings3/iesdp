Applies the non-detection effect to the targeted creature(s), setting <a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT21">STATE_NONDETECTION</a> while active. This effect is negated by <a href="#op70">opcode #70</a>. While in the non-detection state, the creature is immune to <a href="#op47">opcode #47</a> and <a href="#op116">opcode #116</a>, though they are affected by effects that remove illusionary protections by school or secondary type.

{% capture note %}
<code>Timing Mode</code>s <code>1/4/7</code> will permanently set the creature's <code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm#CREV1_0_Header_0x20_BIT21">STATE_NONDETECTION</a></code> flag, leaving no removable effect. This flag is not cleared on death.
