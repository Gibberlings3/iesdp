Sets the individual reputation of the targeted creature(s) to the value specified by the 'Statistic Modifier' field in the style specified by the 'Type' field.
<br/>This does not affect the main reputation of the Party - This is not true for the EEs. Though it can affect ranger/paladinhood of any target.
<br/>Known values for 'Type' are:
<br/>0   Cumulative Modifier -> Reputation = Reputation + 'Statistic Modifier' value
<br/>1   Flat Value Modifier -> Reputation = 'Statistic Modifier' value
<br/>2   Percentage Modifier -> Reputation = (Reputation * 'Statistic Modifier' value) / 100
<br/>3   Increment Party Reputation -> by 10x param#1, cannot lower reputation below 100, will raise reputation to 100 if already less (only in EEs)
<br/>4   Reset Party Reputation to 100 (only in EEs)
