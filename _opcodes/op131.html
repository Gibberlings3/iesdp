Applies the chant effect to the targeted creature(s). Chant affects the minimum damage caused by a weapon (up to the normal maximum damage of the weapon) and the attack roll modifier (up to a maximum of 20, excluding natural attack roll modifiers, e.g. high STR, invisibility etc) by 'Statistic Modifier' amount. The effect sets STATE_CHANT.
<br/>'Modifier' must be in the [-6,5] range.
