Does not remove any other death STATEs from the creature (as <a href="#op13">opcode 13</a> does).<br />
While the end result is otherwise the same as "Stoned Death" applied by <a href="#op13">opcode 13</a>, this opcode does not actually utilize <a href="#op13">opcode 13</a> (internally or otherwise), unlike most (all?) other forms of death.
