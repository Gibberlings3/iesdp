Polymorphs the targeted creature(s) into the creature specified by the <code>resource</code> key, in the style specified by the <code>Type</code> field.
<br/>Known values for <code>Type</code> are:
<ul>
	<li>0 &longrightarrow; Gain Resistances/statistics (spell-casting disabled)</li>
	<li>1 &longrightarrow; Appearance only</li>
</ul>

<p>
	This effect sets <a href="../files/ids/bgee/stats.htm#59">POLYMORPHED</a> to <code>1</code> but only if <code>Type=0</code>.
</p>

<p>
	If the <code>resource</code> key is empty, other Polymorph effects are removed, allowing for removal of permanent effects.
	<ul>
		<li>It will also remove any item in <a href="../files/ids/bgee/slots.htm#34">Magical Weapon Slot</a>, whether or not it was supplying a Polymorph effect.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

{% capture note %}
At least on EE games, this opcode is bugged when you shapechange between two different non-natural forms. In particular:
<ul>
	<li>All your equipment will be considered as "unequipped" (in particular, you will lose passive bonuses/maluses granted by your Rings, Amulet, Helmet and the like).</li>
</ul>
{% endcapture %}

{% include bug.html %}

{% capture note %}
When <code>Type</code> is <code>0</code>, this opcode sets Strength, Dexterity, Resistances (excluding Poison and Magic Damage), Base AC, Specific AC (Crushing/Slashing/Piercing/Missile), and Base APR.
{% endcapture %}

{% include note.html %}

{% capture note %}
When the <code>resource</code> key is empty, and it subsequently clears other Polymorph effects, <code>Type</code> is used just like <code>param#1</code> of <a href="#op337">opcode #337</a>.<br/>
As a result, it will clear all Polymorph effects if <code>Type = "-1"</code>, else it will only clear Polymorph effects that have a <code>param#2</code> that matches.

<ul>
	<li><code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm#effv2_Body_0x60">Parameter3</a></code> (external <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a>): Circle Size</li>

</ul>
These two values are not functional (changing them does nothing), but they do get set on the effect.

The creature you're polymorphing into cannot have <a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT0">STATE_SLEEPING</a>, <a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT6">STATE_FROZEN_DEATH</a>, <a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT7">STATE_STONE_DEATH</a>, <a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT9">STATE_FLAME_DEATH</a>, or <a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT11">STATE_DEAD</a> set in its <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm#CREV1_0_Header_0x20">CRE</a> file, or the game will crash.
