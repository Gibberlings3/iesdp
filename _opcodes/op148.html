{% capture note %}
This opcode should generally target "Self". In particular:
<ul>
	<li>The projectile of the subspell will originate from the target(s) of op148.</li>
	<li>If the SPL/ITM with op148 targets a location, and doesn't have an area-effect projectile, there will be no target to cast on.</li>
	<li>If the SPL/ITM with op148 has an area-effect projectile, the spell in op148 would be cast once for every valid target.</li>
	<li>If this opcode uses the "Cast Instantly" option, then the target, not the caster, would cast the spell in op148.</li>
</ul>
