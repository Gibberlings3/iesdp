Moves the targeted creature(s) to area ".ARE" (a non-existent area). Also known as <a href="../scripting/actions/bgeeactions.htm#111">Script: Destroy Self</a>.
<br/><br/>

This deletes non-global creatures from the game (most common usage).
<br/><br/>

For Global Creatures:
<ul>
	<li>This effect removes the creature from the player's party (if they were in it).</li>
	<li>The effect will keep the creature out of the party and any other Area for its duration, but does not re-instate the creature once it expires.</li>
	<li>They can still be recovered through script actions once the effect expires.</li>
</ul>

{% capture note %}
Both parameters should be <code>0</code> (zero).
