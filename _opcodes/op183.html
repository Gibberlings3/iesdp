Applies the effect specified by the <code>resource</code> key to the targeted creature(s) when an item of the item type specified by the <code>Type</code> field is equipped.

{% capture note %}
Ammo (i.e., <code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/itm_v1.htm#Header_ItemType_5">Arrows</a></code>, <code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/itm_v1.htm#Header_ItemType_14">Bullets</a></code> and <code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/itm_v1.htm#Header_ItemType_31">Bolts</a></code>) does not work well with this opcode. The Ammo Slots are always "Equipped", even when they are not in use. In other words: they trigger <a href="#op183">opcode #183</a> just by being in a quiver slot, regardless of whether the correct launcher is equipped or even active.
<br/>The offhand has the same issue â€“ even when disabled, it's detected by this opcode as equipped.
<br/>Having said that, this opcode currently allows detecting a launcher using its automated ammo (such as Shortbow of Gesen).
