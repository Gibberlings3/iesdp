Marks the targetted creature(s) as travelling to the area specified by the <code>resource</code> key. The creature appears in the specified area after a delay (specified by the <code>Delay</code> field), with the orientation specified by the <code>Orientation</code> field.<br/>
In particular:
<ul>
	<li>Global Creatures ignore the delay.</li>
	<li>If the creature is already in the specified area, it will ignore the delay.</li>
	<li>Non-global creatures currently in a different area than specified will use the delay.</li>
	<li>Delay is measured in <small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub></small> seconds, (&frac12; tick), <code>600 = 20 seconds</code>.</li>
	<li>
		On non-EE games, the creature appears at the point specified by the Target Point fields (external <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a> files only).
		<ul>
			<li>On EE games, target(s) appear at Caster's Coordinates in new area (it does not seem to be possible to override through EFFs).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Creature is moved to the new area (instantly) and flagged <code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm#CREV1_0_Header_Flags_BIT14">Moving Between Areas</a></code> until their delay expires (if it's used). It won't be active until the delay expires (it's hidden, cannot be affected by Area-effect, doesn't occupy space). It can still be targeted by the various <code>Everyone</code> targeting modes in the new area while it's still inactive, but similar to <a href="#op213">maze</a>/<a href="#op211">imprisonment</a>, effects won't trigger (including <a href="#op25">poison</a> and similar) on them until they become active.</li>
</ul>

{% capture note %}
IWD2: there was a note to not use this effect in older IESDP.<br/>
There is some confusion whether the Target (bg1, iwds) or the Caster point field is used.

{% capture note %}
Avoid saving during the delay (can lead to lost NPCs or crashes if you load while NPC's are still in transition).
