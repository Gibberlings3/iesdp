This effect is always instantaneous (local variables are stored internally, not as effects, while the game is running). All local variables for a <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm">CRE</a> are stored as <a href="#op187">opcode #187</a> effects on that <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm">CRE</a> whenever the game is saved, which will trigger as soon as the game is loaded.
