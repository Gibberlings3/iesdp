The targeted creature(s) will reflect a number of effects (specified by the <code>Total Amount</code> field) whose <code>Power</code> attribute is equal to the one specified by the <code>Power Level</code> field (<code>range: 0 – 9</code>).

<p>
	The <code>Power</code> level of the first effect to trigger any instance of this opcode's reflection will determine how much this opcode's <code>Total Amount</code> is decremented. Every instance of this opcode on the creature will be decremented by this amount.
	<ul>
		<li>Example – Minor Spell Turning applies <a href="#op200">opcode #200</a> 4 times, with <code>parameter2 = (1, 2, 3, and 4)</code>, and <code>parameter1</code> based on caster level. If any of them trigger, all of them will be decremented by the same amount. It doesn't matter that they come from the same spell. If you cast both Spell Turning and Minor Spell Turning, all instances of <a href="#op200">opcode #200</a> from both spells would be decremented, even if the spell(effect) triggering it was level 5–9 (above what Minor Spell Turning can reflect).</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	On EE games, <code>resource</code> field &longrightarrow; Spell cast when this effect self-terminates, <code>default = Parent + "B"</code>.

{% capture note %}
As of EE v2.6, spells can no longer be "chained" back and forth by reflection.<br><br>

If Caster and Target are both affected by this opcode, the spell from Caster will reflect off Target, but not reflect back off Caster. Previously, whoever had more reflection charges would end up victorious, now the initial target always ends up victorious.
