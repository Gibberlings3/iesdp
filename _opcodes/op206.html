{% capture note %}
At least in EEs, this opcode can block <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a> files too.<br/>
In order to do so, both the <code>Resource</code> field of <a href="#op206">opcode #206</a> and the <code>Parent resource</code> field (located at offset <code>0x94</code>) of the EFF file must be the same string (max. 8 character long); moreover, you must set the <code>Resource type</code> field (located at offset <code>0x90</code>) of the EFF file to <code>1</code> (<code>Spell</code>).
