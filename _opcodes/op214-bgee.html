Uses the 2da specified by the <code>resource</code> key to display multiple spell options, based on the <code>Type</code> field.
<br/>Known values for <code>Type</code> are:
<ul>
	<li>0 &longrightarrow; Use <code>resource</code> 2da list</li>
	<li>1 &longrightarrow; Known mage spells, except Identify (<code>SPWI110</code>), and Nahal's Reckless Dweomer (<code>SPWI124</code>)</li>
	<li>2 &longrightarrow; Known mage spells, except the above, and those with <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/spl_v1.htm#Header_Flags">spell flag</a> BIT15 "Ignore Wild Surge"</li>
</ul>

When <code>Type</code> is <code>0</code>, the 2da file must follow the following format:<br/>
<pre>
2DA V1.0
****
ResRef		Type
name		RESREF			Casting Type
name		RESREF			Casting Type
</pre>
<br/>

<code>name</code> can be any string of characters/numbers without any whitespace, and does not need to be unique. <code>RESREF</code> is the filename of the spell without its <code>.SPL</code> extension.<br/>
As far as <code>Casting Type</code> is concerned:
<ul>
	<li>0/1 &longrightarrow; Spell completely mimics the mechanics of casting a spell from a quick-cast slot (including requiring and expending a memorization of the spell)</li>
	<li>3 &longrightarrow; Ignores Spells/Round rule, ignores memorization.</li>
	<li>4 &longrightarrow; Ignores Spells/Round rule, ignores memorization, spellcasting cannot be interrupted by damage.</li>
	<li>5 &longrightarrow; Ignores Spells/Round rule, cast instantly, even if the game is paused, can be cast without memorization, but will decrement memorization if exists.</li>
</ul>

{% capture note %}
The target of this effect must be the only currently selected character when it triggers, and remain the selected character until a spell is chosen, or the menu will terminate.
{% endcapture %}

{% include important.html %}

{% capture note %}
The presence of this effect in any of a spell's ability headers will force any Wild Surge of that spell to use the 'Cast Normal' result.
