Drains levels from the targeted creature(s) as specified by the <code>Amount</code> field. <code>Amount</code> can be positive or negative.<br/>
In particular:
<ul>
	<li>Alters the targeted creature(s) Base THAC0, Saving Throws, Hit Points, and Spell Slots as appropriate for their new effective level.</li>
	<li>Thief skills are adjusted depending of the class and kit of the creature.</li>
	<li>Rangers, Shamans, and Bards have their value adjusted as appropriate for their new effective level based on files <a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/skillrng.htm">SKILLRNG.2DA</a>, <a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/skillshm.htm">SKILLSHM.2DA</a>, and <a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/skillbrd.htm">SKILLBRD.2DA</a>, respectively.</li>
	<li>Monks and Thieves skills are all adjusted by the average amount of skill points they receive per level (regardless of which skills they were spent on), applied and capped (range: <code>[0,255]</code>) before racial and/or dexterity adjustments.</li>
	<li>All effects using <code>Timing Mode 2</code> (equipped) that alter the above stats are suppressed.</li>
	<li>The targeted creature(s) cannot level-up.</li>
	<li>The targeted creature(s) current experience is hidden (they still gain experience as normal).</li>
	<li>This effect is removed, regardless of <code>Timing Mode</code>, by any death that sets <a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT11">STATE_DEAD</a>.</li>
</ul>

Moreover:
<ul>
	<li><code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm#effv2_Body_0x60">Parameter3</a></code> is used internally to store recalculated current hp.</li>
	<li><code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm#effv2_Body_0x64">Parameter4</a></code> is used internally to store recalculated max xp.</li>
</ul>

<br/>This effect sets <a href="../files/ids/bgee/stats.htm#200">LEVELDRAIN</a> to <code>Amount</code>.
