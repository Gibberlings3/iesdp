Applies the time stop effect. 
<br/>The timestop effect lasts half as long as the <code>Duration</code> specified for the effect.
<br/><br/>

In particular:
<ul>
	<li>All creatures not immune to Time Stop will be rendered uncontrollable, can be hit automatically by attacks as if they were HELPLESS (but do not actually have <code><a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT5">STATE_HELPLESS</a></code> set), and their frequency-based effects will not trigger (<a href="#op25">poison</a>/<a href="#op98">regeneration</a>), but their <code>duration</code> will run.</li>
	<li><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/pro_v1.htm">Projectiles</a> are suspended mid-flight until the Time Stop ends, at which point they will resume normal function.</li>
	<li><code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/pro_v1.htm#0x8_3">Area Effect</a></code> projectiles are suppressed until the Time Stop ends, at which point they will resume normal function, though their duration will run during the Time Stop.</li>
	<li>Projectiles that hit "instantly" (<code>#0</code> and <code>#1</code> for spells/items) are unaffected by Time Stop, which includes all melee weapons.</li>
</ul>

{% capture note %}
Both parameters should be <code>0</code> (zero).

{% capture note %}
Only one creature may have a Time Stop effect running at a time, applying a Time Stop effect during another will override the previous. The caster is always immune to their own Time Stop effect, they do not require <a href="#op310">opcode #310</a>, unless their own Time Stop is at risk of being overridden.
