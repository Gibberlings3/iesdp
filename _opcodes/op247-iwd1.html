Applies the beltyns burning blood effect to the targeted creature(s).
<br/>The affected creature(s) go bersek for the number of attack specified by the 'Strike Number' field, on a failed saving throw vs spells.
<br/>Note: In IWD1 (with no expansions) param1 acts as a bonus to damage, rather than a strike number.
<br/>Note: At least in IWD1, this effect can lead to a crash upon save game loading, if a creature is killed due to this effect.
