Applies the attack nearest creature effect on the targeted creature(s).
<br/>This effect causes the targeted creature(s) to attack the nearest creature. The affected creature becomes berserk and its AI scripts stop running. Grants a +2 bonus to hit and damage with all weapons. Unlike opcode #3, this one can affect enemies as well.
<br/>
<br/>This effect sets stat #144 (BERSERKSTAGE2) to param #2. It also sets the STATE_BERSERK flag.

{% capture note %}
The 'Constant Value' parameter should be non-zero.

{% capture note %}
At least in EEs, the only difference between opcodes #3 and #247, is that #247 will not force the creature(s) to use melee weapons, and is not removed by Opcode #4 (Cure Berserk).
