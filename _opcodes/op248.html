Sets the effect specified by the resource key as a melee effect.
<br/>The specified effect will be applied to the target of each successful melee attack.
<br/>The resource key references a .eff not a .spl.
<br/><br/>Setting parameter2 to 4 (i.e., BIT2) results in restricting this effect to fists only. If you leave it at 0, then all melee weapons are eligible (including fists).
