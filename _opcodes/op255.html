Creates the item specified by the resource key. The number of items created is controlled by the 'Charges' field. The number of secondary charge is determined by P3. The number of tertiary charges is determined by P4 (external eff's). The item is created in the Inventory, and has the 'can not steal' bit set.
<br/>NB. The difference from opcode #122 is that when used in an external .eff, the duration (from the calling file) is specified in days.
