This effect stores the spell resources for an active spell sequencer. These resources are stored in the <code>resource</code> key, VVC field (<code>resource2</code>), and <code>resource3</code>.<br/>
This effect stores spells to be cast through <a href="#op258">opcode #258</a> and <a href="#op260">opcode #260</a>.
<br/>

When used in an external EFF file, known values for <code>Parameter3 (Type)</code> are:
<ul>
	<li>0 &longrightarrow; Hidden – this sequencer is not viewable in the MageBook 'Contingency' screen, and is not removed when activated.</li>
	<li>1 &longrightarrow; Displayed – this sequencer is viewable in the MageBook 'Contingency' screen, and is removed when activated.</li>
</ul>

When used in an external <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a> file, <code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm#effv2_Body_0x90">Parent Type (Source Type)</a></code> may be manually set to influence its behavior. Known values for <code>Parent Type</code> are:
<ul>
	<li>0 &longrightarrow; None – Allows further effects with a matching "Parent Resource" to affect the target.</li>
	<li>1 &longrightarrow; Spell – Any further effects with a matching "Parent Resource" will be blocked by the engine and string <code><a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/enginest.htm#42">STRREF_ERROR_CAN_NOT_CAST_TWO_CONT</a></code> is returned to the combat log.</li>
	<li>2 &longrightarrow; Item – Allows further effects with a matching "Parent Resource" to affect the target.</li>
</ul>

When used in an external <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a> file, <code>Parent Resource (Activation Key)</code> must be manually set to influence its behavior.<br/>
The <code>Activation Key</code> is the "Resource" to be referenced by the effect(s) that will activate this sequencer.<br/>
When set manually, it cannot contain lowercase characters, it MUST be in ALLCAPS, numbers, and/or symbols, or the sequencer cannot be activated.
<br/>

{% capture note %}
The presence of this effect in any of a spell's ability headers will force any Wild Surge of that spell to use the 'Cast Normal' result.

{% capture note %}
<code>Activation Key</code> does not have to reference an actual spell or item resource, it can be any valid string, so long as the effects involved (<a href="#op256">256</a>/<a href="#op257">257</a> and <a href="#op258">258</a>/<a href="#op260">260</a>) use the exact same string.
