Alters the global variable specified by the resource key, in the style specified by the 'Type' field, by the value specified by the 'Value' field.
<br/>Known values for 'Type' are:
<br/>0   Set Global (to 'Value')
<br/>1   Increment Global (by 'Value')
<br/>NB. Since the Resource Key can only be 8 characters long maximum, you can not set a Local Variable with this effect this has a name longer than this amount.
<br/>NB. You can use the VVC field of external EFF files for an additional 8 characters of variable name.
<br/>NB. You can use the 3rd resource field of EFF files for an additional 8 characters.
<br/>NB. All timing modes act as permanent for this effect.
