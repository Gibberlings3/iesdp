Modifies Scripting state to the given value. Scripting State range from 0 to 35. The scripting state can be checked via scripts (see stats.ids), subtract 156 from the stat value to get the scripting state.
<br/>This effect does not have proper bounds checking, and can therefore be used in unintended ways. For example scripting state 13 equals with the NO_CIRCLE attribute (stat=169), and scripting state 1139 ties to PICKPOCKET (stat=29).
