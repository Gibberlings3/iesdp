Existance is the verbal constant group from 69 to 74 (or 70-74). These sounds are randomly played (for non global, alive characters, when not in cutscene or dialog). This stat tunes the frequency of these random strings.
<br/>Known values for 'Constant Value' are:
<br/>-1 - no existance sounds
<br/>0  - standard existance sound frequency
<br/>Other values - random existance sound frequency (the higher the rarer)

{% capture note %}
The effect modifies stat 184, unless param2 is set to 1.
