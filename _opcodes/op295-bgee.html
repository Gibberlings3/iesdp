This targeted creature(s) will never suffer a permanent death (and will therefore always remain resurrectable) - exceptions include petrification and freeze-death.
<br/>The Constant Value parameter should be set to 1, and timing mode should be 9 (Permanent after Death).
<br/>The effect modifies stat 186.
