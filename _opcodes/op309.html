Set both the local variable specified by the resource key to the value specified by the 'Value' field.
<br/>Known values for 'Type' are:
<br/>0   Set Local (to 'Value')
<br/>1   Increment Local (by 'Value')
<br/>NB: Since the Resource Key can only be 8 characters long maximum, you can not set a variable with this Effect this has a name longer than this amount.
<br/>You can use the VVC field of external EFF files for an additional 8 characters of variable name.
<br/>You can use the 3rd resource field of EFF files for an additional 8 characters.
