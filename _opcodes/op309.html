<br/>Known values for <code>Type</code> are:

	<li>1 &longrightarrow; Increment Local (by <code>Value</code>)</li>
</ul>

This effect is always instantaneous (local variables are stored internally, not as effects, while the game is running). All local variables for a <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm">CRE</a> are stored as <a href="#op187">opcode #187</a> effects on that <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm">CRE</a> whenever the game is saved, which will trigger as soon as the game is loaded.

<code>Value</code> can store integers or coordinates. Coordinates are stored as first 2 bytes X, last 2 bytes Y (f.i.: <code>310 + (30 << 16)</code>).
