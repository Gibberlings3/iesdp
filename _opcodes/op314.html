Gives the targeted creature(s) a number of protections from physical attacks, as specified by the <code>Amount</code> field.<br />
This opcode maintains <a href="../files/ids/bgee/stats.htm#199">STONESKINSGOLEM</a> to the amount of skins left.

{% capture note %}
Do not use this effect in conjunction with the Juggernaut Golem Manual as it will corrupt the use of that item.<br/>
In particular, the Juggernaut Golem "TOMEGOL4.CRE" is scripted by "TOMEGOL4.BCS" to "Kill()" itself if its Summoner and no Party Members have <a href="../files/ids/bgee/stats.htm#199">STONESKINSGOLEM</a> set to a non-zero value.
