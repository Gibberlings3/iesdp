The creature type specified by the 'Type' field becomes immune to the spell or item specified in the 'Resource' field. It also gives a message on successful resist.
<br/>Known values for 'Stat Type' are defined in splprot.2da. splprot.2da uses three codes (labeled STAT, VALUE and RELATION) to define a targeting type.
  <br/><br/>STAT is either a straight stat value (listed in stat.ids) or a pseudo stat of the to be targeted creature:
  <br/>0x100 - source equals target
  <br/>0x101 - source is not target
  <br/>0x102 - circle size
  <br/>0x103 - use two rows of splprot.2da
  <br/>0x104 - negate 0x103
  <br/>0x105 - source and target morale match
  <br/>0x106 - areatype (like outdoors, forest, etc)
  <br/>0x107 - time of day (in hours)
  <br/>0x108 - source and target ethical match
  <br/>0x109 - evasion
  <br/>0x10a - EA
  <br/>0x10b - GENERAL
  <br/>0x10c - RACE
  <br/>0x10d - CLASS
  <br/>0x10e - SPECIFIC
  <br/>0x10f - GENDER
  <br/>0x110 - ALIGNMENT
  <br/>0x111 - STATE
  <br/>0x112 - SPELL STATE
  <br/>0x113 - source and target allies
  <br/>0x114 - source and target enemies
  <br/>0x115 - summon creature limit
  <br/>0x116 - chapter check
  <br/><br/>VALUE is a number used to compare to the stat using a relational operator. Depending on the stat/operator it could be a bit value (hexadecimal allowed). If value is set to -1, then 'Value' of the opcode will be used.
  <br/><br/>RELATION is an index to a relational operator:
  <br/>0 - less or equal
  <br/>1 - equal
  <br/>2 - less
  <br/>3 - greater
  <br/>4 - greater or equal
  <br/>5 - not equal
  <br/>6 - binary less or equal (stat doesn't contain extra bits not in value)
  <br/>7 - binary more or equal (stat contains all bits of value)
  <br/>8 - binary match (at least one bit is common)
  <br/>9 - binary not match (none of the bits are common)
  <br/>10 - binary more (stat contains at least one bit not in value)
  <br/>11 - binary less (stat doesn't contain all the bits of value)
