The creature type specified by the <code>Stat Type</code> field will be affected by the spell in the <code>Resource</code> field. See <a href="#op324">opcode #324</a> for more information.

<p>
  The spell specified by the <code>resource</code> field is cast at the same level as the current effect, regardless of <code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/spl_v1.htm#splv1_Header_0x1C">Spell type</a></code>.
</p>

<p>
  Unlike <a href="#op146">opcode #146</a>, when targeting <code>Self</code> or <code>Original Caster</code>, the <code>resource</code> is still cast on the ability target, not the caster.
</p>

<p>
  For the purpose of dispelling effects only, the opcode target (not necessarily the caster) determines the caster level for effects in its <code>resource</code>. It also determines the "Caster location" saved to the V2 effect on creatures. It doesn't transfer full ownership though â€“ the caster is still credited for damage.
</p>

<p>
  If the resource uses projectile <code>#0 (default)</code>:
  <ul>
    <li>the <code>resource</code> will ignore its <code>projectile</code> field, defaulting to use projectile <code>#1|None</code> for all effects.</li>
    <li>Effects in the <code>resource</code> that target <code>Self</code>, <code>Projectile Target</code>, or <code>Original Caster</code> will all affect the target of this effect.</li>
    <li>If this effect is reflected/turned, the target of effects in the <code>resource</code> is reflected.</li>
  </ul>
  Otherwise:
  <ul>
    <li>effects in the <code>resource</code> that target <code>Self</code> will affect the target of this effect, not the caster, </li>
    <li>if this effect is reflected/turned, only effects in the <code>resource</code> targeting <code>Original Caster</code> will be affected, now affecting the target. </li>
  </ul>
</p>

{% capture note %}
If this effect is applied through <a href="#op177">opcode #177</a>, the spell is cast at the level specified at offset <code><a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm#effv2_Body_0xC8">0xc8</a></code> of the <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a>.

Effects in the <code>resource</code> will also bypass Magic Resistance, of every target, as if the caster targeted themselves, regardless of who they target with the spell or this effect.

The only meaningful <code>Timing Mode</code>s for this opcode are: <code>0|Instant/Limited</code> with <code>duration = 0</code>, <code>1|Instant/Permanent</code>, or <code>4|Delayed/Permanent</code>.
