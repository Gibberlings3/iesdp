Summons a number of monsters, equal to the Dice rolls+'Count'. The 'Type' field set which 2da file to pick the creatures to summon from. The 2da files are listed in smtables.2da.
<br/>If the resource field is filled, it will use a .2da to determine which monsters to summon.
<br/>If used from an external effect (.eff), the vvc field controls the bam/vvc file played over the creatures when summoning.
<br/>If used from an external effect (.eff), the second vvc field controls the bam file played over the target area when summoning.

{% capture note %}
Setting 'Mode' to 2 will use the caster's level instead of Dice rolls.
