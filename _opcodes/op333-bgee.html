Casts a secondary spell (default: <code>"original resource" + B</code>) on the target, for a number of strikes specified by the <code>Number</code> field. The spell will be cast once per <code>Delay</code> through its projectile.

<p>
	If a spell <code>Level</code> is not specified, then the spell will be cast at level 1 and the damage opcodes will inherit the dice values of this effect, otherwise the spell will be cast at the given level.
</p>

<p>
	<code>Delay</code> specifies the delay between hits, its default value is <code>6</code> (one round).
</p>

{% capture note %}
Its <code>Saving Throw</code> is checked EVERY time it triggers, terminating the <a href="#op333">opcode #333</a> effect if successful, so unless that is desired (or it only triggers once), it should not have a <code>Saving Throw</code>.
