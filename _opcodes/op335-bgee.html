When the opcode is applied, it checks if the creature currently has the spellstate specified by <code>Spellstate</code> set. Known values for <code>Spellstate</code> are defined in <a href="../files/ids/bgee/splstate.htm">SPLSTATE.IDS</a>.
<br/>

<ul>
	<li>If it's already set, this opcode is NOT applied, nothing happens.</li>
	<li>Otherwise, the opcode is attached, the spellstate becomes set (for the duration of the effect), and the "Resource" specified by the <code>resource</code> key (if any!) is granted to the character (as if through <a href="#op171">opcode #171</a>)</li>
</ul>
<br/>

The next time the row number specified by <code>Row#</code> of <a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/7eyes.htm">7EYES.2DA</a> is triggered (blocks an effect), this effect will terminate, remove the spell it granted (as if through <a href="#op172">opcode #172</a>) and decrement <a href="#op336">opcode #336</a> effects according to their <code>Eye Group</code> (<code>parameter2</code> for <a href="#op336">opcode #336</a>, <code>special</code> field for op#335).
<br/>

{% capture note %}
Setting <code>Row# = "-1"</code> will effectively have it last its full duration, blocking every effect listed for that spellstate in <a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/7eyes.htm">7EYES.2DA</a>.
