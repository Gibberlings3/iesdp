    <br />
    There are two clocks in the IE:<br />
    <ol>
      <li>Real clock that tracks real time the player has spent with the game running (hereafter referred to as CREAL)</li> 
      <li>In-game clock that tracks in-game time - (i.e. time displayed in lower left corner of the game screen) (hereafter referred to as  CINGAME)</li> 
    </ol>
    <br />
    Time is tracked in ticks; by default there are 15 in a second. In BG2 there are 100 ticks in a combat round. A BG round lasts 6, IWD 7 and PST 5 seconds.<br />
    <br />
    When the game starts, both clocks start from 0. When resting, CINGAME is incremented by the time spent resting (usually 8 hours). CREAL is incremented by a the few seconds while the rest movie is played. This puts CINGAME at a higher value than CREAL.<br />
    <br />
    Timers relating to both clocks can be set through scripting:<br />
    <div class="indent1">
      SetGlobalTimer(&quot;TINGAME&quot;,&quot;GLOBAL&quot;,3600) - TINGAME will expire after half a day of in-game time<br />
      RealSetGlobalTimer(&quot;TREAL&quot;,&quot;GLOBAL&quot;,3600) - TREAL will expire after 3600 seconds of real time<br />
    </div>
    <br />
    When this is done, the game takes the values the relevant clocks, adds the specified number (e.g. 3600) and stores the result in a global variable (TINGAME or TREAL), e.g.<br />
    <ul>
      <li>CINGAME = 7,195,874</li>
      <li>CINGAME + 3600 = 7,199,474</li>
      <li>CREAL = 2,395,858</li>
      <li>CREAL + 3600 = 2,399,458</li>
    </ul>
    It should be noticed that TINGAME is higher than TREAL.<br />
    <br />
    Timers can be checked by two commands in scripting:<br />
    <div class="indent1">
      GlobalTimerExpired(&quot;TINGAME&quot;,&quot;GLOBAL&quot;)<br />
      RealGlobalTimerExpired(&quot;TREAL&quot;,&quot;GLOBAL&quot;)<br />
    </div>
    <br />
    To detemine whether timers have expired, the engine subtracts the current clock value from the time value. A negative result means the timer has expired (this is why a timer set 1 will expire instantly). As an example, using GlobalTimerExpired(&quot;TREAL&quot;,&quot;GLOBAL&quot;) the engine will subtract 2,399,458 (the value of TREAL) from 7,195,874 (the value of CINGAME) and return a negative number - hence an expired timer. <br />
