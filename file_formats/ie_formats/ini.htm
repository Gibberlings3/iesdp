    <div class="indent1">
      This file format is the standard INI format with minor deviations. It is text based, split into sections (marked with square brackets [ and ]) with attributes and values listed under each section, separated by an equals sign. Some game configuration settings are stored in INI files, though their use in-game is limited to creature spawning, creature animations, quest/variable management and the PST bestiary. The file format supports single-line comments which are preceded by two consecutive slashes (<span class="code">//</span>) and end with the first occurence of a line break.<br />
