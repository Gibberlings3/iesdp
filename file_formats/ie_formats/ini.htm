    <div class="fileHeader">General Description</div>
    <div class="indent1">
      This file format is the standard INI format. It is text based, split into sections (marked with square brackets [ and ]) with attributes and values listed under each section, separated by an equals sign. Some game configuration settings are stored in INI files, though their use in-game is limited to creature spawning, creature animations, quest/variable management and the PST bestiary. The file format supports single-line comments which are preceded by two consecutive slashes (<span class="code">//</span>) and end with the first occurence of a line break.<br />
    </div>
    <br />



    <div class="fileHeader">Detailed Description</div>
    <div class="indent1">
      Each INI file is attached to an area, based on the filename of the referenced WED resource, e.g. AR0513.INI is attached to AR0513.ARE if the area file references AR0513.WED. However, AR0014.INI is attached to AR0083.ARE if the area file references AR0014.WED instead. It is possible to associate a single INI file with multiple areas that way.<br />
      <br />

      Example from IWD (AR6006.INI):

      There are the following sections in these files:<br />
      <br />

      <strong>[nameless]</strong><br />
      <div class="indent1">
        This section handles various peculiarities stemming from the Nameless One's immortality. This section is only available in PST and PSTEE.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>destare = resref</strong><br />
        This value changes the area where the Nameless One will be resurrected after his death. The party members are teleported there as well.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>point = [x.y]</strong><br />
        These are the alternative map coordinates where the Nameless One will be resurrected after his death. The default is the same slab in the Mortuary where you started the game.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>state = number</strong><br />
        This value indicates the animation sequence (see ANIMSTAT.IDS) used by the Nameless One after being resurrected. It's mostly used to change whether he starts standing or with his special getting-up animation sequence.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>partypoint = [x.y]</strong><br />
        These are the map coordinates where the rest of the party (without TNO) is moved when entering the area specified by <i>partyarea</i>. Used in ar1800, to force only the namesake to be able to enter the Nameless One's Tomb.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>partyarea = resref</strong><br />
        Replacement map for the party, see description above of <i>partypoint</i>.<br />
        <br />
      </div>
      <br />

      <strong>[namelessvar]</strong><br />
      <div class="indent1">
        This section appears to be used to initialize global variables when the Nameless One dies. This section is only available in PST and PSTEE.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>name_of_variable = value</strong><br />
        The specified value is assigned to the global variable "name_of_variable".<br />
        <br />
      </div>
      <br />

      <strong>[locals]</strong><br />
      <div class="indent1">
        This section appears to be used to initialize local variables (LOCALS scope).<br />
        <br />
      </div>
      <br />

      <strong>[spawn_main]</strong><br />
      <div class="indent1">
        This section is responsible for spawning creatures. It supports the following attributes:<br />
        <br />

        <strong>enter = name_of_group_section</strong><br />
        This attribute expects one or more comma-separated names of group sections. It is executed by the engine whenever the player enters the area.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>exit = name_of_group_section</strong><br />
        This attribute expects one or more comma-separated names of group sections. It is executed by the engine whenever the player leaves the area. It is only supported by PST, IWD and IWD2.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>event = name_of_group_section</strong><br />
        This attribute expects one or more comma-separated names of group sections. It is executed by the engine whenever the conditions defined by the assigned sections are met.<br />
        <br />
      </div>
      <br />


      <strong>[name_of_group_section]</strong><br />
      <div class="indent1">
        This section controls a group of individual spawn sections. It supports the following attributes:<br />
        <br />

        <strong>critters = name_of_creature_section1,name_of_creature_section2,...</strong><br />
        This attribute expects a comma-separated sequence of creature section names. These sections define individual creatures with their spawn conditions, attributes and behavior. Each listed creature section is evaluated and executed when their spawn conditions are met.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>interval = number</strong><br />
        Time interval, measured in AI ticks (15 ticks = 1 second), before creature sections defined by the "critters" attribute are evaluated. This attribute is only relevant if the section is linked to the "event" attribute of the [spawn_main] section.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>detail_level = name</strong><br />
        This was possibly a memory saving option, but eventually got excluded — it is controlled by the "Detail level" key not present by default in torment.ini. Known attribute values: <span class="code">High, Medium, Low</span>. However the engine has a bug and treats Medium entries as High. It is only supported by PST.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>control_var = ???</strong><br />
        <span class="unknown">The meaning of this attribute is unknown.</span> <strong>Note:</strong> In BGEE specifying this attribute causes the game to crash.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>spawn_time_of_day = ???</strong><br />
        This attribute has no effect, as the engines have no code for it. It is unused.<br />
        <br />
      </div>
      <br />


      <strong>[name_of_creature_section]</strong><br />
      <div class="indent1">
        This section defines the spawn conditions, behavior and attributes of a single creature type. It can be referenced by the "critters" attribute of group sections. It supports the following attributes:<br />
        <br />

        <strong>spec_var = variable_name</strong><br />
        This attribute expects the name of a variable. It uses the global scope by default, but can optionally be preceded by the variable scope and two consecutive colons (e.g. AR0500::MY_VAR). The variable is checked for non-zero. Only a single variable can be evaluated per creature section.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>spec = filter_value</strong><br />
        This attribute expects either a script name or a target specification between square brackets in the order [EA.FACTION.TEAM.GENERAL.RACE.CLASS.SPECIFIC.GENDER.ALIGN]. These specification values are checked by the engine whenever the spawning process is triggered to determine whether a new instance of the creature can be spawned.<br />
        A specified script name is checked against the script name of the spawned creature. A target specification in square brackets is checked against the respective numeric attributes of the spawned creature. A value of 0 is considered a wildcard. Faction and Team may not be available for all games. Just like the target notation in scripts it is not necessary to specify all fields. Unlisted fields are treated as 0.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>spec_area = ???</strong><br />
        <span class="unknown">The meaning of this attribute is unknown.</span><br />
        <br />

        This attribute specifies the total amount of creatures matching the given "spec" attribute that can be spawned on the map. Number of spawns is limited to the value defined by the "create_qty" attribute. Default value: same as "create_qty", 1 otherwise.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>spec_var_inc = number</strong><br />
        This attribute specifies the amount to increment the variable defined by the "spec_var" attribute per spawn operation. It is only supported by IWD2.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>spec_var_value = number</strong><br />
        This attribute expects a numeric reference value which is compared according to the "spec_var_operation" attribute. It is only supported by IWD2.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>spec_var_operation = operation</strong><br />
        This attribute expects an operation mode. It is used to compare the content of the variable specified by the "spec_var" attribute with the value defined by the "spec_var_value" attribute.<br />
        Known operations:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="code">greater_than</span>: spec_var &gt; spec_var_value</li>
          <li><span class="code">less_than</span>: spec_var &lt; spec_var_value</li>
          <li><span class="code">equal_to</span>: spec_var == spec_var_value</li>
          <li><span class="code">not_equal_to</span>: spec_var != spec_var_value</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>area_diff_2 = boolean_value</strong><br />
        <strong>area_diff_3 = boolean_value</strong><br />
        Indicates the area difficulty where an instance of this creature should be spawned. It mirrors the area difficulty mask defined in ARE V9.1 actor structures. It is only supported by IWD2.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>cre_file = resref</strong><br />
        This attribute expects the resref of the CRE file to spawn when all conditions are met.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>create_qty = number</strong><br />
        This attribute controls how many instances of the current creature are spawned at once. Number is limited by the value specified by the "spec_qty" attribute. Default value: same as "spec_qty", 1 otherwise.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>script_name = string</strong><br />
        This attribute expects the script name for the spawned creature. It should not exceed 32 characters. The string can be used for targeting in scripts. It is functionally identical to the name of ARE actor structures.<br />

        <br />

        <strong>point_select = letter</strong><br />
        This attribute expects a single letter which controls various aspects of the spawning process.<br />
        Known attribute values are:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="code">E</span>: Indicates that the spawn location and orientation are retrieved from predefined game variables defined by "spawn_point_global" and "spawn_facing_global" respectively.</li>
          <li><span class="code">R</span>: Indicates that the spawn location is chosen at random from the map coordinates defined by the "spawn_point" attribute.</li>
          <li><span class="code">S</span>: Indicates that a single spawn location is chosen from the map coordinates defined by the "spawn_point" attribute and reused by subsequent spawn operations.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>point_select_var = ???</strong><br />
        <span class="unknown">The meaning of this attribute is unknown.</span><br />
        <br />

        <strong>facing = number</strong><br />
        This attribute expects a numeric value in the range 0..15 for the creature's orientation where 0=south, 4=west, 8=north and 12=east. It is used by PST if the orientation is omitted by the "spawn_point" attribute.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>ignore_can_see = boolean_value</strong><br />
        This attribute indicates whether a creature can be spawned even if the spawn point is within visual range of the party. By default creatures are only spawned off-screen.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>check_crowd = boolean_value</strong><br />
        <span class="unknown">The meaning of this attribute is unknown.</span><br />

        <br />

        <strong>save_selected_facing = variable_name</strong><br />
        This attribute instructs the engine to store the orientation of the spawned creature in the specified variable.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>spawn_point_global = variable_name</strong><br />
        This attribute expects a variable name that is used to retrieve the map coordinates for the spawned creature. It requires the "point_select" attribute to be set to <span class="code">E</span>.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>spawn_facing_global = variable_name</strong><br />
        This attribute expects a variable name that is used to retrieve the orientation for the spawned creature. It requires the "point_select" attribute to be set to <span class="code">E</span>. <strong>Note:</strong> This attribute doesn't appear to work correctly in BGEE.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>inc_spawn_point_index = ???</strong><br />
        <span class="unknown">The meaning of this attribute is unknown.</span><br />
        <br />

        <strong>hold_selected_point_key = ???</strong><br />
        <span class="unknown">The meaning of this attribute is unknown.</span><br />
        <br />

        <strong>check_by_view_port = ???</strong><br />
        The meaning of this attribute is not fully understood, but when on it limits spawning to outside of the current viewport (part of the area currently displayed). <i>ignore_can_see</i> also has to be set and at least in PSTEE, the spawnpoint has to be within visual range. It's unused in the originals under this name, but there are plenty of uses of <i>check_view_port</i> </span><br />
        <br />

        <strong>do_not_spawn = boolean_value</strong><br />
        This attribute indicates that the creature should not be spawned at all.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>auto_buddy = boolean_value</strong><br />
        <span class="unknown">It is likely that this attribute controls whether all nearby creatures turn party-hostile when the spawned creature calls for help.</span> It is only supported by PST.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>time_of_day = value</strong><br />
        This attribute controls at what time the creature can be spawned. The value is interpreted as a bitfield similar to the appearance schedule field in ARE actor structures. <strong>Note:</strong> In BGEE specifying this attribute causes the game to crash.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>disable_renderer = boolean_value</strong><br />
        This attribute indicates whether the animation of the spawned creature should be rendered on the game screen. The state is not stored in saved games. Regardless of their rendering state the spawned creature takes up personal space, and the mouse cursor will react appropriately when placed over their current location. The script action "SetRenderable(O:Target*,I:Renderable*Boolean)" can be used to further control the rendering state of the creature. This attribute is only supported by PSTEE.<br />
