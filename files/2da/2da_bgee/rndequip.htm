This file defines what items are generated when a creature uses an item of filename RNDEQUx#.ITM, where x=any character (even letters and symbols, and has no bearing on how RNDEQUIP.2DA is read), and #=the row number of RNDEQUIP.2DA to use (can be 1-9).  RNDEQUx#.ITM is replaced by the generated item.  Therefore, this works like a random treasure table.<br />
<br />
The first column of RNDEQUIP.2DA specifies the name of the row, currently a simple generic name.  The rest of the 20 columns have headers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 18, 19, 20.  Note that this is different from RNDTREAS.2DA and RNDMAGIC.2DA, which do not have the column labelled '1', but similar to RNDSCROL.2DA and RNDWEP.2DA.  Only 21 columns in total are supported, else the 2da file will fail to work entirely.  When this happens, all RNDEQUx#.ITMs are replaced by erroneous invisible items that cannot be removed.<br />
<br />
The BG2EE version of RNDEQUIP.2DA is shown below.  As an example of how RNDEQUIP.2DA is used, a creature has the item RNDEQU01.ITM.  As soon as the creature is created, row 1 of RNDEQUIP.2DA is read.  2D10 dice are rolled, and produce a value of 6.  Row 1, column 6 reads LEAT05.  Therefore, RNDEQU01.ITM on that creature is replaced by LEAT05.<br />
<br />
In BG2EE we have:<br />

RNDEQUIP.2DA supports 9 functional rows of random treasure.  Rows 10 and above are completely ignored.  If RNDEQUx#.ITM references a non-existant or an ignored row number (or if #=0 under any circumstances), then RNDEQUx#.ITM is replaced by an erroneous invisible item that cannot be removed. Note that the replacing item is NOT RNDEQUx#.ITM itself, in this case. This blank item can likely be altered by setting the default 2da entry to a valid item.<br />
<br />
Items that can be referenced:<br />
<ul>
<li>Specific items, such as LEAT05 in the above example (for stackable items, a *# suffix, that is, an asterisk followed by a number, can be added to the item ResRef to specify the amount of that item to create, e.g. BOLT04*4 generates a single stack of 4 BOLT04 items; for non-stackable items, a *# suffix does nothing; the limitations on the size of # are the same as that for gold pieces described below)</li>
<li>#, that is, a number, refers to a gold value (e.g. #=016 replaces RNDEQUx#.ITM with a stack of 16 gold).  The maximum stack of gold allowable is 256 pieces.  More than that listed will max out at 231 (interestingly, this is the remainder when you divide 256 into 999; # need not be three digits, so if #=4 or #=04 or #-004, a stack of 4 gold will still be generated without error)-*, that is, a single asterisk, generates an erroneous item, i.e. an invisible item that cannot be removed.  This is useful if you want your creature not to drop anything, but you do not want to use this for containers and item piles</li>
<li>RNDMAG##, which references RNDMAGIC.2DA, where ##=row number to use, allowing further randomisation; a D20 is rolled to determine which column of this file to use</li>
<li>RNDSCR##, which references RNDSCROL.2DA, where ##=row number to use, allowing further randomisation; 2D10 are rolled to determine which column of this file to use</li>
<li>RNDTRE##, which references RNDTREAS.2DA, where ##=row number to use, allowing further randomisation; a D20 is rolled to determine which column of this file to use</li>
<li>RNDWEP##, which references RNDWEP.2DA, where ##=row number to use, allowing a third level of randomisation; 2D10 are rolled to determine which column of this file to use</li>
</ul>
<br />
Items that cannot be referenced:<br />
<ul>
<li>RNDEQU##; using this will create RNDEQU##.ITM, exactly as it is (circular loops are not possible)</li>
</ul>
<br />
Since RNDEQUIP.2DA can reference RNDTREAS.2DA, RNDMAGIC.2DA, RNDSCROL.2DA, and RNDWEP.2DA, this 2da file is the top of the random treasure table hierarchy.
