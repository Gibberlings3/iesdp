Interplay MVE file format
=========================

Note: Throughout this document, a "word" is a 16-bit value.  All values are
      little-endian, unless otherwise specified.

The high-level format of an Interplay MVE file is a small header, followed by
variable sized stream chunks; each stream chunk consists of a word giving the
length of the chunk, and another giving the type, followed by a stream of 1 or
more stream opcodes, which consist of a two-word count for the length of the
stream opcode, a single byte for the type, a single byte (which I believe to
be a "version" field, to allow backwards compatibility ), and then variable
data depending on the type of opcode.

So, just to make sure that's clear, we've got the header, followed by a
2-level hierarchical structure:

        ||           CHUNK1         ||           CHUNK2         ||
header  || op1 || op2 || op3 || op4 || op1 || op2 || op3 || op4 || ...

Header
------

The Header of an Interplay MVE file must start with the sequence of bytes:

    "Interplay MVE File\x1A\0"

where \x1A represents ASCII 0x1a (^Z), the old DOS end-of-file character, and
\0 represents ASCII 0x00 (NUL).  The reason for this is then, under DOS, if
you do:

C:\>TYPE foobar.MVE

you'll see

Interplay MVE File

After these 20 bytes, there are 6 more bytes, which I believe are either a
file format version, a "magic" number, or were, once upon a time, parameters.
In modern Interplay games, these parameters appear to need to be hard-coded.
They take the form of 3 words:

001a 0100 1133

Immediately following this are the chunks.

Chunks
------

Each chunk consists of a word giving the total length of the data contained in
the chunk, and another word which represents the type of the chunk.  After
these four bytes (which are NOT included in the chunk length), comes the chunk
data.  The types of chunks I know about (i.e. which are used in BG/BG2 movies
that I've examined; the chunk types are not used at all in the movie playback
code in BG/BG2) are:

0000: initialize audio
0001: audio only chunk (or maybe only used for audio pre-buffering)
0002: initialize video
0003: video chunk (usually includes audio.  possibly always includes audio)
0004: shutdown chunk
0005: end chunk

I don't know why an "end chunk" is needed, since the "shutdown chunk" seems to
do that job nicely.  The "end chunk" appears to contain no opcodes.

Opcodes
-------

The opcodes I've observed range from 0x00 to 0x15.  Of these, the current code
used in BG/BG2 uses only from 0x00 through 0x11, so any guesses as to the
function of 0x12 through 0x15 would be merely speculation.  I have no idea
what any of these opcodes are used for.  But, again, since they are unused in
the BG/BG2 movie player code, they are unnecessary for playback.

Opcode 0x00: End Of Stream
    No data associated with this.  When this opcode is seen, the playback of
    the movie stops immediately.

Opcode 0x01: End Of Chunk
    All this opcode does in theory is to terminate a chunk.  In practice, it
    signals the code to fetch and decode the next chunk.

Opcode 0x02: Create Timer
    DWORD   timer rate
    WORD    timer subdivision

    This sets up the timer that drives the animation.  Basically, every time
    the timer expires, it should be starting to pump out the next frame in
    order to keep up with the desired frame rate.

    The normal values I've seen here are 0x2095 for the timer rate (8341), and
    8 for the timer subdivision.  What this means in practice is that every
    8*8341 (=66728) microseconds, it should be ready to send out the next
    frame.  So...  10000000/66728 == 14.9 frames per second typically.  The
    exact purpose for the timer subdivision is unclear to me, but it may be an
    artifact of earlier methods of timer handling, since some of the code here
    appears to possibly even date back to the DOS days.

Opcode 0x03: Initialize Audio Buffers
    version 0:
        WORD    (unknown)
        WORD    flags
        WORD    sample rate
        WORD    min buffer length

    version 1:
        WORD    (unknown)
        WORD    flags
        WORD    sample rate
        DWORD   min buffer length

    The flags recognized, as of version 0 are:
        bit 0: 0=mono,  1=stereo
        bit 1: 0=8-bit, 1=16-bit

    The flags recognized, as of version 1 are:
        bit 0: 0=mono,  1=stereo
        bit 1: 0=8-bit, 1=16-bit
        bit 2: 0=uncompressed, 1=compressed

    Only uncompressed audio is supported in the version 0 opcode.  I _think_
    the other 13 bits (14 bits for ver. 0) here may be garbage.  Whatever they
    are, they are not apparently used for the playback engine inside BG/BG2.

    The sample rate is the standard sampling rate in kHz; typically 22050 in
    the BG movies.  Buffer length is the size (in bytes) of the buffer that
    needs to be allocated for the audio.  (I don't remember if this is the
    _total_ audio buffer size needed, or if this number is a "per-channel"
    number that needs to be doubled for "stereo" audio streams.)  They use 1.5
    times the original buffer size in order to have a "safety zone".

    I will cover the format of the compressed audio data in the audio data
    opcode section.

Opcode 0x04: Start/Stop Audio

    This seems to start and/or stop the audio playback.  This opcode contains
    no data.

Opcode 0x05: Initialize Video Buffer(s)
    version 0:
        WORD    width
        WORD    height

    version 1:
        WORD    width
        WORD    height
        WORD    ?count?

    version 2:
        WORD    width
        WORD    height
        WORD    ?count?
        WORD    true-color

    Width is the width of the buffer to allocate, and height is the height.
    Both are given in terms of pixels.  Now, the count appears to be used to
    over-allocate the video buffer.  To compute the size to allocate for the
    video buffer, they take 2 bytes per pixel, and multiply by the height and
    the width, and then multiply by the count.  If scan-line doubling is
    enabled (which it is not in BG/BG2), it then divides this value by two, on
    the assumption that there is only enough data for half the resolution.
    Anyway, the over-allocation may be used to create a larger movie area and
    pan smoothly or something.  I haven't seen a way to use the overallocation
    with the format details that I've discerned, but the video coding is
    particularly hairy, as the decoder relies on self-modifying x86 code to
    function.  Yick.  Anyway, I'm still in the process of looking for a file
    that uses over-allocation so that I can figure out exactly why it is used
    and what it is used for.  (Again, this feature doesn't appear to be widely
    used in the sampling of BG/BG2 movies that I've examined.)  Note that an
    alternate possibility for the usage of the over-allocated space is as
    scratch space.  This possbility will be addressed in the (voluminous!)
    documentation for opcode 0x11.

Opcode 0x06: unknown
    4 bytes apparently unused?
    WORD    unknown
    WORD    unknown
    WORD    unknown
    WORD    flip back buffer? (0=no, 1=yes)
    bytes   unknown

    I haven't seen this opcode used in any BG/BG2 movies; however, this may be
    used for the panning or some clever usage of the over-allocation mentioned
    in opcode 0x05.  If "flip back buffer?" has bit 0 set, it will flip the
    two allocated buffers before it does whatever it is that it does.

    The "whatever it does" appears to be characterized by bulk memory moves,
    which makes it possible that it _is_ used in conjunction with the
    over-allocated video buffers.

    No "version" check is made for this opcode, which makes me suspect that
    there is only 1 supported version of this opcode.  (version 0, presumably)

Opcode 0x07: Send Buffer to Display
    version 0:
        WORD    palette start
        WORD    palette count

    version 1:
        WORD    palette start
        WORD    palette count
        WORD    ???

    palette start is the index of the first palette entry to be installed
    before copying from the current back buffer to the display.  palette count
    is the number of palette entries to be installed.  As for the mysterious
    other flag...  I am still unclear on its usage.  Again, I've seen no
    example of its usage yet.

Opcode 0x08: Audio Frame (data)
Opcode 0x09: Audio Frame (silence)
    WORD    seq-index
    WORD    stream-mask
    WORD    stream-len
    data    audio data (only for Opcode 0x08)

    seq-index is the sequential index of this audio chunk, numbered from 0000
    (0000 being the first chunk in the audio file).  stream-mask works as
    follows:

    a given mve file can contain up to 16 parallel audio streams.  Presumably
    this is for alternate languages.  The stream-mask determines which
    stream(s) a given audio chunk belongs to.  So, if bit 0 is set in the
    stream-mask, it belongs to stream 0.  Typically, in the English language
    version of BG, I've seen the sole audio frame (opcode 8) having bit 0 set,
    and the next silent frame having all 15 of the other bits set.

    So, just to make this clear, what we see is:
        opcode 8: idx=0 mask=0x0001 len=0x16d8 data=...
        opcode 9: idx=0 mask=0xfffe len=0x16d8

    These audio chunks appear to always come in pairs.

    stream-len is the total number of samples in the chunk.

    Now, the audio data, if it is compressed, is compressed by first applying
    a delta coding.  These deltas are then quantized to a particular set of
    codes and are stored as 8-bit offsets into this quantized table.  It is
    important to track the last "delta" for each channel from audio chunk to
    audio chunk (with the initial value being the first word in the first
    chunk).  For stereo data, the two channels are compressed separately; the
    first TWO words in the first chunk, then are the left and right channel's
    initial bias, respectively, and with the samples being interleaved L R L
    R.  (i.e. every other byte being Left channel).  The particular table used
    for the delta coding is:

         0,      1,      2,      3,      4,      5,      6,      7,      8,      9,     10,     11,     12,     13,     14,     15,
        16,     17,     18,     19,     20,     21,     22,     23,     24,     25,     26,     27,     28,     29,     30,     31,
        32,     33,     34,     35,     36,     37,     38,     39,     40,     41,     42,     43,     47,     51,     56,     61,
        66,     72,     79,     86,     94,    102,    112,    122,    133,    145,    158,    173,    189,    206,    225,    245,

       -66,    -61,    -56,    -51,    -47,    -43,    -42,    -41,    -40,    -39,    -38,    -37,    -36,    -35,    -34,    -33,
       -32,    -31,    -30,    -29,    -28,    -27,    -26,    -25,    -24,    -23,    -22,    -21,    -20,    -19,    -18,    -17,
       -16,    -15,    -14,    -13,    -12,    -11,    -10,     -9,     -8,     -7,     -6,     -5,     -4,     -3,     -2,     -1

    The included code for decompressing audio in this format should make this
    a little clearer.  (It handles only the stereo case at present.)

Opcode 0xa: Initialize Video Mode
    WORD    X-resolution
    WORD    Y-resolution
    WORD    flags

    The usage of the flags field appears to be largely historical.  Perhaps
    with the introduction of DirectX as the underlying medium, rather than the
    direct graphics hardware manipulation that was, apparently, used in an
    earlier version, this field is unnecessary.  (In fact, in BG, this entire
    opcode turns into a no-op.)  (Note, for the curious: BG actually contains
    assembly code to do register level manipulation of VGA hardware.  Not
    enough to actually really do much, but it's there, anyway.

Opcode 0xb: Create Gradient
    BYTE    baseRB
    BYTE    numR_RB
    BYTE    numB_RB
    BYTE    baseRG
    BYTE    numR_RG
    BYTE    numG_RG

    I haven't seen this particular opcode used, but it is clear that it
    generates a gradient palette.  It appears that it will generate two
    gradient palettes, if both count0 and count1 are non-zero.  The first
    gradient is a pure red-blue gradient, and the second a pure red-green
    gradient.  It appears to be designed for EGA/VGA hardware, since it uses
    0-63 as the maximum range for a component within a color.  The red
    component of each gradient moves linearly from 0 to 63 within numR_RB
    (resp. numR_RG) rows, and the blue or green component moves linearly from
    0 to 39 within numB_RB (resp numG_RG) columns for the blue or green
    gradient respectively.

    The colors are ordered in row-major ordering, starting at the 'base'th
    entry.  So, if you had:

    baseRB=12
    numR_RB=5
    numB_RB=4

    You'd get 20 colors starting at index #12, with a row-major gradient.
    Specifically you'd see:

    ( 0,0,0) ( 0,0,13) ( 0,0,26) ( 0,0,39)  ; 12...15
    (15,0,0) (15,0,13) (15,0,26) (15,0,39)  ; 16...19
    (31,0,0) (31,0,13) (31,0,26) (31,0,39)  ; 20...23
    (47,0,0) (47,0,13) (47,0,26) (47,0,39)  ; 24...27
    (63,0,0) (63,0,13) (63,0,26) (63,0,39)  ; 28...31

Opcode 0xc: Set Palette
    WORD    pal-start
    WORD    pal-count
    data    pal-data

    pal-start indicates the first palette entry to fill
    pal-count indicates the number of palette entries to fill
    pal-data is the palette data, 3 bytes per palette entry, packed as:

    RGBRGBRGB

Opcode 0xd: Set Palette Entries Compressed
    data    compressed palette data

    This doesn't appear to have been used in the BG movies.  This is a series
    of 32 entries of the following form:

    <byte> <RGB> <RGB> ... <RGB>

    Where there are between 0 and 8 <RGB> values, taking 3 bytes apiece.

    Each bit in the preceding byte determines which of the 8 palette entries
    have an RGB value stored for them, with the least significant bit
    corresponding to the first entry in the group of 8.  So, in order to set
    only the 240th entry in the palette, the data would be:

    00              ;; 00-07
    00              ;; 08-0f
    00              ;; 10-17
    00              ;; 18-1f
    00              ;; 20-27
    00              ;; 28-2f
    00              ;; 30-37
    00              ;; 38-3f
    00              ;; 40-47
    00              ;; 48-4f

    00              ;; 58-5f
    00              ;; 60-67
    00              ;; 68-6f
    00              ;; 70-77
    00              ;; 78-7f

    Giving:
        00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
        00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 rr gg bb
        00 00 00

    35 bytes of data instead of 768 to store the whole palette.

Opcode 0xe: ???
    data    unknown length

    I haven't encountered this value before.  What it does is set a pointer to
    an array of words used during decoding of data using the 0x10 opcode,
    which I have also not encountered.

    I'm still working on figuring out the use of this opcode and the 0x10
    opcode, but they don't appear to be used in the BG movies, again.  See my
    comments at opcode 0x10 for more details.

Opcode 0xf: Set Decoding Map
    data    decoding map

    The decoding map is a particular data block used in the decoding of video
    frames, as encoded via opcode 0x11.  I'll cover it in detail when I get to
    opcode 0x11.

Opcode 0x10: ???

    This is another means of storing video data.  I haven't seen it used yet,
    and am still sorting through the details.  This seems to be tied in with
    the issue of multiple pages of video memory, as with opcode 6 and the
    "count" field of opcode 5.

    Note that this opcode makes use of 3 (!) data streams, as opposed to 2 for
    0x11.  Even so, it appears to be a much simpler encoding.  The data
    streams used for this are the most recent 0xe opcode data stream, the most
    recent 0xf opcode data stream, and this opcode's data stream.

    There appears to be verbatim pixel data encoded in the 0x10 stream, but
    the which pixels have been stored, among other things, is determined by
    the other streams.  It also appears that in this stream all pixel
    manipulation is done in 8-pixel wide and 8-pixel tall units.  This is
    set-up to loop first over each column, then over each row, then finally
    over each page:

        foreach page
            foreach row
                foreach col
                    decode opcode data

    If I can find an example of one of these files to mess around with, I will
    complete my analysis of this opcode.

Opcode 0x11: Video Data

    Ok, this is the big killer opcode.  The way this works is as follows:

    First, the data is processed in 8x8 pixel blocks.  There are 4 bits
    associated with each block giving the particular encoding to use for that
    block, giving a total of 16 possible encodings for a given block.  These
    4-bit pieces come from the most recent 0xf opcode data stream.  They all
    appear to be used (or at least supported by the player).  So, I'll go over
    the encodings for each of the 16 encoding types.  The rendering process
    keeps track of the most recent frame in a separate buffer, and uses this
    double-buffering technique in the common way for animation.  The current
    frame's data is used in the construction of the next frame.  In the
    following description, "current frame" will refer to the most recently
    displayed frame, and "new frame" will refer to the frame currently being
    constructed for display.  "map stream" will refer to the data grabbed from
    the 0xf Opcode data, and "data stream" will refer to the data grabbed from
    the 0x11 opcode data.

        Encoding 0x0:
            Block is copied from corresponding block from current frame.
            (i.e. this block is unchanged).

        Encoding 0x1:
            Block is unmodified.  This appears to mean that it has the same
            value it had 2 frames ago, but the net effect is that nothing is
            done to this block of 8x8 pixels.

        Encoding 0x2:
            Block is copied from nearby (below and to the right) within the
            new frame.  The offset within the buffer from which to grab the
            patch of 8 pixels is given by grabbing a byte B from the data
            stream, which is broken into a positive x and y offset according
            to the following mapping:

                if B < 56:
                    x = 8 + (B % 7)
                    y = B / 7
                else
                    x = -14 + ((B - 56) % 29)
                    y =   8 + ((B - 56) / 29)

            (where % is the 'modulo' operator)

            If you draw the region this represents, you'll see it looks like:

                       oooooooo#######
                       oooooooo#######
                       oooooooo#######
                       oooooooo#######
                       oooooooo#######
                       oooooooo#######
                       oooooooo#######
                       oooooooo#######

         ##########################

         Where 'o' are the pixels in the destination frame, and # are the
         locations where the source frame could start.

        Encoding 0x3:
            This is the same as encoding 0x2, with the exception that the x
            and y offsets are negated giving:

                if B < 56:
                    x = -(8 + (B % 7))
                    y = -(B / 7)
                else
                    x = -(-14 + ((B - 56) % 29))
                    y = -(  8 + ((B - 56) / 29))

            (where % is the 'modulo' operator)

            If you draw the region this represents, you'll see it looks like:

        Encoding 0x4:
            Similar to 0x2 and 0x3, except this method copies from the
            "current" frame, rather than the "new" frame, and instead of the
            lopsided mapping they use, this one uses one which is symmetric
            and centered around the top-left corner of the block.  This uses
            only 1 byte still, though, so the range is decreased, since we
            have to encode all directions in a single byte.  The byte we pull
            from the data stream, I'll call B.  Call the highest 4 bits of B
            BH and the lowest 4 bytes BL.  Then the offset from which to copy
            the data is:

                x = -8 + BL
                y = -8 + BH

        Encoding 0x5:
            Similar to 0x4, but instead of one byte for the offset, this uses
            two bytes to encode a larger range, the first being the x offset
            as a signed 8-bit value, and the second being the y offset as a
            signed 8-bit value.

        Encoding 0x6:
            I can't figure out how any file containing a block of this type
            could still be playable, since it appears that it would leave the
            internal bookkeeping in an inconsistent state in the BG player
            code.  Ahh, well.  Perhaps it was a bug in the BG player code that
            just didn't happen to be exposed by any of the included movies.
            Anyway, this skips the next two blocks, doing nothing to them.
            Note that if you've reached the end of a row, this means going on
            to the next row.

        Encoding 0x7:
            Ok, here's where it starts to get really...interesting.  This is,
            incidentally, the part where they started using self-modifying
            code.  So, most of the following encodings are "patterned" blocks,
            where we are given a number of pixel values and then bitmapped
            values to specify which pixel values belong to which squares.  For
            this encoding, we are given the following in the data stream:

                P0 P1

            These are pixel values (i.e. 8-bit indices into the palette).  If
            P0 <= P1, we then get 8 more bytes from the data stream, one for
            each row in the block:

                B0 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7

            For each row, the rightmost pixel is represented by the low-order
            bit, and the leftmost by the high-order bit.  Use your imagination
            in between.  If a bit is set, the pixel value is P1 and if it is
            unset, the pixel value is P0.

            If, on the other hand, P0 > P1, we get two more bytes from the
            data stream:

                B0 B1

            Each of these bytes contains a 4-bit pattern.  This pattern works
            exactly like the pattern above with 8 bytes, except each bit
            represents a 2x2 pixel region.

            So, for example, if we had:

                11 22 ff 81 81 81 81 81 81 ff

            This would represent the following layout:

                22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22     ; ff == 11111111
                22 11 11 11 11 11 11 22     ; 81 == 10000001
                22 11 11 11 11 11 11 22     ; ..
                22 11 11 11 11 11 11 22
                22 11 11 11 11 11 11 22
                22 11 11 11 11 11 11 22
                22 11 11 11 11 11 11 22     ; 81 == 10000001
                22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22     ; ff == 11111111

            If, on the other hand, we had:

                22 11 ff 81

            The output would be:

                22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22     ; f == 1 1 1 1
                22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22     ; 
                22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22     ; f == 1 1 1 1
                22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22     ; 
                22 11 11 11 11 11 11 11     ; 8 == 1 0 0 0
                22 11 11 11 11 11 11 11     ; 
                11 11 11 11 11 11 11 22     ; 1 == 0 0 0 1
                11 11 11 11 11 11 11 22     ; 

        Encoding 0x8:
            Ok, this one is basically like encoding 0x7, only more
            complicated.  Again, we start out by getting two bytes on the data
            stream:

                P0 P1

            if P0 <= P1 then we get the following from the data stream:

                      B0 B1
                P2 P3 B2 B3
                P4 P5 B4 B5
                P6 P7 B6 B7

            P0 P1 and B0 B1 are used for the top-left corner, P2 P3 B2 B3 for
            the bottom-left corner, P4 P5 B4 B5 for the top-right, P6 P7 B6 B7
            for the bottom-right.  (So, each codes for a 4x4 pixel array.)
            Since we have 16 bits in B0 B1, there is one bit for each pixel in
            the array.  The convention for the bit-mapping is, again, left to
            right and top to bottom.

            So, basically, the top-left quarter of the block is an arbitrary
            pattern with 2 pixels, the bottom-left a different arbitrary
            pattern with 2 different pixels, and so on.  I'll go through a few
            examples of this after I discuss the other forms for the data in
            this encoding.

            if P0 > P1 then we get 10 more bytes from the data stream:

                B0 B1 B2 B3 P2 P3 B4 B5 B6 B7

            Now, if P2 <= P3, then [P0 P1 B0 B1 B2 B3] represent the left half
            of the block and [P2 P3 B4 B5 B6 B7] represent the right half.

            If P2 > P3, [P0 P1 B0 B1 B2 B3] represent the top half of the
            block and [P2 P3 B4 B5 B6 B7] represent the bottom half.

            In these last two cases, each bit represents a 1x1 pixel.  Just to
            work through an example of each case:

                00 22 f9 9f 11 33 cc 33 44 55 aa 55 66 77 01 ef

                22 22 22 22 | 33 33 11 11     ; f = 1111, c = 1100
                22 00 00 22 | 33 33 11 11     ; 9 = 1001, c = 1100
                22 00 00 22 | 11 11 33 33     ; 9 = 1001, 3 = 0011
                22 22 22 22 | 11 11 33 33     ; f = 1111, 3 = 0011
                ------------+------------
                55 44 55 44 | 66 66 66 66     ; a = 1010, 0 = 0000
                55 44 55 44 | 66 66 66 77     ; a = 1010, 1 = 0001
                44 55 44 55 | 77 77 77 66     ; 5 = 0101, e = 1110
                44 55 44 55 | 77 77 77 77     ; 5 = 0101, f = 1111

            I've added a dividing line in the above to clearly delineate the
            quadrants.

            Now, for a horizontally split block:

                22 00 01 37 f7 31 11 66 8c e6 73 31

                22 22 22 22 66 11 11 11
                22 22 22 00 66 66 11 11
                22 22 00 00 66 66 66 11
                22 00 00 00 11 66 66 11
                00 00 00 00 11 66 66 66
                22 00 00 00 11 11 66 66
                22 22 00 00 11 11 66 66
                22 22 22 00 11 11 11 66

            Finally, for a vertically split block:

                22 00 cc 66 33 19 66 11 18 24 42 81

                00 00 22 22 00 00 22 22
                22 00 00 22 22 00 00 22
                22 22 00 00 22 22 00 00
                22 22 22 00 00 22 22 00
                66 66 66 11 11 66 66 66
                66 66 11 66 66 11 66 66
                66 11 66 66 66 66 11 66
                11 66 66 66 66 66 66 11

        Encoding 0x9:
            Similar to the previous 2 encodings, only more complicated.  And
            it will get worse before it gets better.  No longer are we dealing
            with patterns over two pixel values.  Now we are dealing with
            patterns over 4 pixel values with 2 bits assigned to each pixel
            (or block of pixels).

            So, first on the data stream are our 4 pixel values:

                P0 P1 P2 P3

            Now, if P0 <= P1  AND  P2 <= P3, we get 16 bytes of pattern, each
            2 bits representing a 1x1 pixel (00=P0, 01=P1, 10=P2, 11=P3).  The
            ordering is again left to right and top to bottom.  The most
            significant bits represent the left side at the top, and so on.

            If P0 <= P1  AND  P2 > P3, we get 4 bytes of pattern, each 2 bits
            representing a 2x2 pixel.  Ordering is left to right and top to
            bottom.

            if P0 > P1  AND  P2 <= P3, we get 8 bytes of pattern, each 2 bits
            representing a 2x1 pixel (i.e. 2 pixels wide, and 1 high).

            if P0 > P1  AND  P2 > P3, we get 8 bytes of pattern, each 2 bits
            representing a 1x2 pixel (i.e. 1 pixel wide, and 2 high).

        Encoding 0xa:
            Similar to the previous, only a little more complicated.
            We are still dealing with patterns over 4 pixel values with 2 bits
            assigned to each pixel (or block of pixels).

            So, first on the data stream are our 4 pixel values:

                P0 P1 P2 P3

            Now, if P0 <= P1, the block is divided into 4 quadrants, ordered
            (as with opcode 0x8) TL, BL, TR, BR.  In this case the next data
            in the data stream should be:

                                B0  B1  B2  B3
                P4  P5  P6  P7  B4  B5  B6  B7
                P8  P9  P10 P11 B8  B9  B10 B11
                P12 P13 P14 P15 B12 B13 B14 B15

            Each 2 bits represent a 1x1 pixel (00=P0, 01=P1, 10=P2, 11=P3).
            The ordering is again left to right and top to bottom.  The most
            significant bits represent the left side at the top, and so on.

            If P0 > P1 then the next data on the data stream is:

                            B0 B1 B2  B3  B4  B5  B6  B7
                P4 P5 P6 P7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15

            Now, in this case, if P4 <= P5,
            [P0 P1 P2 P3 B0 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7] represent the left half of
            the block and the other bytes represent the right half.  If P4 >
            P5, then [P0 P1 P2 P3 B0 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7] represent the top
            half of the block and the other bytes represent the bottom half.

        Encoding 0xb:
            In this encoding we get raw pixel data in the data stream -- 64
            bytes of pixel data.  1 byte for each pixel, and in the standard
            order (l->r, t->b).

        Encoding 0xc:
            In this encoding we get raw pixel data in the data stream -- 16
            bytes of pixel data.  1 byte for each block of 2x2 pixels, and in
            the standard order (l->r, t->b).

        Encoding 0xd:
            In this encoding we get raw pixel data in the data stream -- 4
            bytes of pixel data.  1 byte for each block of 4x4 pixels, and in
            the standard order (l->r, t->b).

        Encoding 0xe:
            This encoding represents a solid frame.  We get 1 byte of pixel
            data from the data stream.

        Encoding 0xf:
            This encoding represents a "dithered" frame, which is
            checkerboarded with alternate pixels of two colors.  We get 2
            bytes of pixel data from the data stream, and these bytes are
            alternated:

                P0 P1 P0 P1 P0 P1 P0 P1
                P1 P0 P1 P0 P1 P0 P1 P0
                ...
                P0 P1 P0 P1 P0 P1 P0 P1
                P1 P0 P1 P0 P1 P0 P1 P0

Opcode 0x12: Not observed in BG movies, and not used by the player

Opcode 0x13: Unknown.  Used in the BG movies, but not used by the player.
             Appears to always(?) have 0x84 bytes of data.  This is a
             recurrent opcode, appearing in most, if not all video chunks.

Opcode 0x14: Not observed in BG movies, and not used by the player

Opcode 0x15: Unknown.  Used in the BG movies, but not used by the player.
             Appears to always(?) have 4 bytes of data.  This one appears
             in the "video initialization chunk"

=================================
